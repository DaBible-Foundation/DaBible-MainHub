<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 15</div><div class='s'>God’s Agreement With Abram </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>After all these things happened, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision. God said, “Abram, don’t be afraid. I will defend you and give you a great reward.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>But Abram said, “Lord GOD, there is nothing you can give me that will make me happy, because I have no son. My slave Eliezer from Damascus will get everything I own after I die.”  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Abram said, “You have given me no son, so a slave born in my house will get everything I have.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then the LORD spoke to Abram and said, “That slave will not be the one to get what you have. You will have a son who will get everything you own.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then God led Abram outside and said, “Look at the sky. See the many stars. There are so many you cannot count them. Your family will be like that.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Abram believed the LORD, and because of this faith the Lord accepted him as one who has done what is right.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He said to Abram, “I am the LORD who led you from Ur of Babylonia.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Ur of Babylonia Literally, “Ur of the Chaldeans.” A city in southern Babylonia.</span></a> I did this so that I could give you this land. You will own this land.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But Abram said, “Lord GOD, how can I be sure that I will get this land?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>God said to Abram, “We will make an agreement. Bring me a three-year-old cow, a three-year-old goat, a three-year-old ram, a dove, and a young pigeon.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Abram brought all these to God. Abram killed these animals and cut each of them into two pieces. Then he laid each half across from the other half. He did not cut the birds into two pieces.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Later, large birds flew down to eat the animals, but Abram chased them away. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The sun began to go down and Abram got very sleepy. While he was asleep, a very terrible darkness came over him.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then the Lord said to Abram, “You should know this: Your descendants will live in a country that is not their own. They will be strangers there. The people there will make them slaves and be cruel to them for 400 years.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But then I will punish the nation that made them slaves. Your people will leave that land, and they will take many good things with them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>“You yourself will live to be very old. You will die in peace and will be buried with your family.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>After four generations your people will come to this land again and defeat the Amorites. That will happen in the future because the Amorites are not yet guilty enough to lose their land.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>After the sun went down, it got very dark. The dead animals were still on the ground, each animal cut into two pieces. Then a smoking firepot<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> firepot A clay pot in which burning coals were placed to be used for starting new fires.</span></a> and a flaming torch passed between the halves of the dead animals.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> passed between … animals This showed that God “signed” or “sealed” the agreement he made with Abram. People showed that they were sincere in making an agreement by walking between the parts of animals that had been cut into pieces and saying something like, “May this same thing happen to me if I don’t keep the agreement.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>So on that day the LORD made a promise and an agreement with Abram. He said, “I will give this land to your descendants. I will give them the land between the River of Egypt<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> River of Egypt That is, the stream called “Wadi El-Arish.”</span></a> and the great river Euphrates.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>This is the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
