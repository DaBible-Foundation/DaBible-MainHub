<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 4</div><div class='s'>A Story About a Farmer Sowing Seed </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 13:1–9; Lk. 8:4–8) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Another time Jesus began teaching by the lake, and a large crowd gathered around him. He got into a boat so that he could sit and teach from the lake. All the people stayed on the shore near the water.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Jesus used stories to teach them many things. One of his lessons included this story: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>“Listen! A farmer went out to sow seed.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>While he was scattering the seed, some of it fell by the road. The birds came and ate all that seed.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Other seed fell on rocky ground, where there was not enough dirt. It grew quickly there because the soil was not deep.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But then the sun rose and the plants were burned. They died because they did not have deep roots.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Some other seed fell among thorny weeds. The weeds grew and stopped the good plants from growing. So they did not make grain.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But some of the seed fell on good ground. There it began to grow, and it made grain. Some plants made 30 times more grain, some 60 times more, and some 100 times more.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then Jesus said, “You people who hear me, listen!” </div><div class='s'>Why Jesus Used Stories to Teach </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 13:10–17; Lk. 8:9–10) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Later, Jesus was away from the people. The twelve apostles and his other followers asked him about the stories. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Jesus said, “Only you can know the secret truth about God’s kingdom. But to those other people I tell everything by using stories.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I do this so that </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>‘They will look and look but never really see; </div><div class='q2'>they will listen and listen but never understand. </div><div class='q'>If they saw and understood, </div><div class='q2'>they might change and be forgiven.’ ” <span class='rq'>Isaiah 6:9-10</span> </div><div class='s'>Jesus Explains the Story About Seed </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 13:18–23; Lk. 8:11–15) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then Jesus said to the followers, “Do you understand this story? If you don’t, how will you understand any story?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The farmer is like someone who plants God’s teaching in people.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Sometimes the teaching falls on the path. That is like some people who hear the teaching of God. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the teaching that was planted in them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>“Other people are like the seed planted on rocky ground. They hear the teaching, and they quickly and gladly accept it.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But they don’t allow it to go deep into their lives. They keep it only a short time. As soon as trouble or persecution comes because of the teaching they accepted, they give up. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>“Others are like the seed planted among the thorny weeds. They hear the teaching,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>but their lives become full of other things: the worries of this life, the love of money, and everything else they want. This keeps the teaching from growing, and it does not produce a crop<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> produce a crop Meaning to do the good things God wants his people to do.</span></a> in their lives. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>“And others are like the seed planted on the good ground. They hear the teaching and accept it. Then they grow and produce a good crop—sometimes 30 times more, sometimes 60 times more, and sometimes 100 times more.” </div><div class='s'>Use the Understanding You Have </div><div class='r'>(Lk. 8:16–18) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then Jesus said to them, “You don’t take a lamp and hide it under a bowl or a bed, do you? Of course not. You put it on a lampstand.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Everything that is hidden will be made clear. Every secret thing will be made known.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>You people who hear me, listen!  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Think carefully about what you are hearing. God will know how much to give you by how much you understand now. But he will give you more than you deserve.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The people who have some understanding will receive more. But those who do not have much will lose even the small amount they have.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Uses a Story About Seed </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then Jesus said, “God’s kingdom is like a man who plants seed in the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The seed begins to grow. It grows night and day. It doesn’t matter whether the man is sleeping or awake, the seed still grows. He doesn’t know how it happens.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Without any help the ground produces grain. First the plant grows, then the head, and then all the grain in the head.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>When the grain is ready, the man cuts it. This is the harvest time.” </div><div class='s'>What Is God’s Kingdom Like? </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 13:31–32, 34–35; Lk. 13:18–19) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then Jesus said, “What can I use to show you what God’s kingdom is like? What story can I use to explain it?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>God’s kingdom is like a mustard seed, which is smaller than any other seed on earth that you can plant.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But when you plant it, it grows and becomes the largest of all the plants in your garden. It has branches that are very big. The wild birds can come and make nests there and be protected from the sun.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Jesus used many stories like these to teach the people. He taught them all they could understand.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>He always used stories to teach them. But when he was alone with his followers, Jesus explained everything to them. </div><div class='s'>Jesus’ Followers See His Power </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 8:23–27; Lk. 8:22–25) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>That day, at evening, Jesus said to his followers, “Come with me across the lake.”  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>So they left the crowd behind and went with Jesus in the boat he was already in. There were also other boats that went with them.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>A very bad wind came up on the lake. The waves were coming over the sides and into the boat, and it was almost full of water.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Jesus was inside the boat, sleeping with his head on a pillow. The followers went and woke him. They said, “Teacher, don’t you care about us? We are going to drown!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Jesus stood up and gave a command to the wind and the water. He said, “Quiet! Be still!” Then the wind stopped, and the lake became calm. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>He said to his followers, “Why are you afraid? Do you still have no faith?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>They were very afraid and asked each other, “What kind of man is this? Even the wind and the water obey him!” </div><ul class='tnav'>
