He will punish them for their sins.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then the LORD said to me, “Jeremiah, don’t pray for good things to happen to the people of Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They might begin to fast and pray to me, but I will not listen to their prayers. Even if they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings to me, I will not accept them. I will destroy the people of Judah with war. I will take away their food, and they will starve. And I will destroy them with terrible diseases.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But I said, “Lord GOD, the prophets were telling the people something different. They were telling the people of Judah, ‘You will not suffer from war or from hunger. The Lord will give you peace in this land.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then the LORD said to me, “Jeremiah, those prophets are telling lies in my name. I did not send them or command them or speak to them. Their prophecies came from false visions, worthless magic, and their own wishful thinking.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So this is what I, the LORD, say about the prophets who are speaking in my name. I did not send them. They said, ‘No enemy will ever attack this country. There will never be hunger in this land.’ So those prophets will die from hunger or by an enemy’s sword.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the people they spoke to will be thrown into the streets. The people will die from hunger and war. I will punish them, and no one will be there to bury them, their wives, their sons, or their daughters. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>“Jeremiah, speak this message to the people of Judah: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>‘My eyes fill with tears </div><div class='q2'>night and day without stopping. </div><div class='q'>I cry for my virgin daughter,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> virgin daughter Another name for Jerusalem.</span></a> and for my dear people, </div><div class='q2'>because someone hit them and crushed them. </div><div class='q2'>They have been hurt very badly. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>If I go into the country, </div><div class='q2'>I see the bodies of those killed in war. </div><div class='q'>If I go into the city, </div><div class='q2'>I see people sick from hunger. </div><div class='q'>The priests and prophets continue their work, </div><div class='q2'>but they don’t understand what is happening.’ ” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Lord, have you completely rejected the nation of Judah? </div><div class='q2'>Do you hate Zion? </div><div class='q'>You hurt us so badly that we cannot be made well again. </div><div class='q2'>Why did you do that? </div><div class='q'>We were hoping for peace, </div><div class='q2'>but nothing good has come. </div><div class='q'>We were hoping for a time of healing, </div><div class='q2'>but only terror came. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>LORD, we know that we are wicked. </div><div class='q2'>We know that our ancestors did evil things. </div><div class='q2'>Yes, we sinned against you. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For the good of your name, don’t push us away. </div><div class='q2'>Don’t take away the honor from your glorious throne. </div><div class='q'>Remember your agreement with us </div><div class='q2'>and do not break it. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Foreign idols don’t have the power to bring rain. </div><div class='q2'>The sky does not have the power to send down showers of rain. </div><div class='q'>You, the LORD our God, are our only hope. </div><div class='q2'>You are the one who made all these things. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><ul class='tnav'>
