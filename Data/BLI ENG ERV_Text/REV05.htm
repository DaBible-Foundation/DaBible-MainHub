<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 5</div><div class='s'>Who Can Open the Scroll? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then I saw a scroll in the right hand of the one sitting on the throne. The scroll had writing on both sides and was kept closed with seven seals.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And I saw a powerful angel, who called in a loud voice, “Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?”  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But there was no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth who could open the scroll or look inside it.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I cried and cried because there was no one who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But one of the elders said to me, “Don’t cry! The Lion<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Lion Used here to refer to Jesus.</span></a> from the tribe of Judah has won the victory. He is David’s descendant. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then I saw a Lamb standing in the center near the throne with the four living beings around it. The elders were also around the Lamb. The Lamb looked as if it had been killed. It had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God that were sent into all the world.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The Lamb came and took the scroll from the right hand of the one sitting on the throne.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>After the Lamb took the scroll, the four living beings and the 24 elders bowed down before the Lamb. Each one of them had a harp. Also, they were holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of God’s holy people.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And they all sang a new song to the Lamb: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“You are worthy to take the scroll </div><div class='q2'>and to open its seals, </div><div class='q'>because you were killed, </div><div class='q2'>and with your blood sacrifice you bought people for God </div><div class='q2'>from every tribe, language, race of people, and nation. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>You made them to be a kingdom and to be priests for our God. </div><div class='q2'>And they will rule on the earth.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then I looked, and I heard the voices of many angels. The angels were around the throne, the four living beings, and the elders. There were thousands and thousands of angels—10,000 times 10,000.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The angels said in a loud voice, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“All power, wealth, wisdom, and strength </div><div class='q2'>belong to the Lamb who was killed. </div><div class='q'>He is worthy to receive </div><div class='q2'>honor, glory, and praise!” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then I heard every created being that is in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, everything in all these places, saying, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“All praise and honor </div><div class='q2'>and glory and power forever and ever </div><div class='q2'>to the one who sits on the throne and to the Lamb!” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The four living beings said, “Amen!” And the elders bowed down and worshiped. </div><ul class='tnav'>
