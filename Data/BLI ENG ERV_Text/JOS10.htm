<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 10</div><div class='s'>The Day the Sun Stood Still </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>At this time Adoni Zedek was the king of Jerusalem. He heard that Joshua had defeated Ai and completely destroyed it. The king learned that Joshua had done the same thing to Jericho and its king. He also learned that the Gibeonites had made a peace agreement with Israel and that they lived very near Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>So Adoni Zedek and his people were very frightened. Gibeon was not a small town like Ai. It was a very big city—as big as any royal city.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> royal city A strong, well-protected city that controlled smaller towns nearby.</span></a> And all the men in that city were good fighters, so the king was afraid.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>King Adoni Zedek of Jerusalem talked with King Hoham of Hebron. He also talked with King Piram of Jarmuth, King Japhia of Lachish, and King Debir of Eglon. The king of Jerusalem begged these men,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>“Come with me and help me attack Gibeon. Gibeon has made a peace agreement with Joshua and the Israelites.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So these five Amorite kings joined their armies together. (The five kings were the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.) Their armies went to Gibeon, surrounded the city, and began fighting against it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The people in the city of Gibeon sent a message to Joshua at his camp at Gilgal: “We are your servants! Don’t leave us alone. Come and help us! Hurry! Save us! All the Amorite kings from the hill country have brought their armies together to fight against us.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So Joshua marched out of Gilgal with his whole army. His best fighting men were with him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The LORD said to Joshua, “Don’t be afraid of those armies. I will allow you to defeat them. None of them will be able to defeat you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Joshua and his army marched all night to Gibeon, so it was a complete surprise when he attacked them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The LORD caused those armies to be very confused when Israel attacked. So Israel defeated them and won a great victory. Israel chased the enemy from Gibeon along the road going up to Beth Horon. The army of Israel killed men all the way to Azekah and Makkedah.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then they chased the enemy down the road from Beth Horon to Azekah. While they were chasing the enemy, the LORD caused large hailstones to fall from the sky. Many of the enemy were killed by these large hailstones. More men were killed by the hailstones than by the swords of the soldiers of Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>On that day the LORD gave Israel the victory against the Amorites. Joshua stood before all the Israelites and said to the LORD: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Sun, stop over Gibeon. </div><div class='q2'>Moon, stand still over the Valley of Aijalon.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So the sun did not move, and the moon stopped until the people defeated their enemies. This story is written in the <span class='bk'>Book of Jashar</span>. The sun stopped in the middle of the sky. It did not move for a full day.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>That had never happened before, and it has never happened again. That was the day the LORD obeyed a man. The LORD really was fighting for Israel! </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>After this, Joshua and his army went back to the camp at Gilgal.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But during the fight, the five kings ran away. They hid in a cave near Makkedah,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>but someone found them hiding in that cave. Joshua learned about this.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He said, “Cover the entrance to the cave with large rocks. Put some men there to guard the cave.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But don’t stay there yourselves. Continue chasing the enemy and attacking them from behind. Don’t let the enemy get back to their cities. The LORD your God has given you the victory over them.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So Joshua and the Israelites killed the enemy. But some of them were able to go to their cities that had tall walls around them and hide. These men were not killed.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>After the fighting, Joshua’s men came back to him at Makkedah. Not one of the people in that country was brave enough to say anything against the Israelites. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Joshua said, “Move the rocks that are covering the entrance to the cave. Bring the five kings to me.”  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So Joshua’s men brought the five kings out of the cave—the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>When they brought the five kings to Joshua, he called all his men to come to that place. He said to the officers of his army, “Come here! Put your feet on the necks of these kings.” So the officers of Joshua’s army came close and put their feet on the necks of the kings. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then Joshua said to his men, “Be strong and brave! Don’t be afraid. I will show you what the LORD will do to all the enemies you will fight in the future.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then Joshua killed the five kings and hanged their bodies on five trees. He left them hanging in the trees until evening.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>At sunset Joshua told his men to take the bodies down from the trees. So they threw the bodies into the cave where the kings had been hiding and covered the entrance of the cave with large rocks. Their bodies are still in that cave today. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>That day Joshua defeated Makkedah. He killed the king and the people in that city. No one was left alive. Joshua did the same thing to the king of Makkedah that he had done to the king of Jericho. </div><div class='s'>Taking the Southern Cities </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then Joshua and all the Israelites traveled from Makkedah to Libnah and attacked that city.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The LORD allowed the Israelites to defeat that city and its king. They killed everyone in the city. No one was left alive. And they did the same thing to that king as they had done to the king of Jericho. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then Joshua and all the Israelites left Libnah and went to Lachish. Joshua and his army camped around that city and attacked it.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The LORD allowed them to defeat the city of Lachish. They defeated it on the second day. The Israelites killed everyone in the city, just as they had done in Libnah.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>King Horam of Gezer came to help Lachish, but Joshua also defeated him and his army. No one was left alive. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then Joshua and all the Israelites traveled from Lachish to Eglon. They camped around Eglon and attacked it.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>That day they captured the city and killed everyone in the city. This was the same thing they had done to Lachish. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Then Joshua and all the Israelites traveled from Eglon to Hebron and attacked it.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>They captured the city and all the small towns near Hebron. The Israelites killed everyone in the city, just as they did to Eglon. No one was left alive there. They destroyed the city and killed all the people in it as an offering to the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Then Joshua and all the Israelites went back to Debir and attacked it.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>They captured the city, its king, and all the towns near Debir. They killed everyone in the city, just as they had done to Libnah and its king. No one was left alive there. They destroyed the city and killed all the people in it as an offering to the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>So Joshua defeated all the kings of the cities of the hill country, the Negev, the western foothills, and the eastern foothills. The LORD, the God of Israel, had told Joshua to kill all the people, so Joshua did not leave anyone alive in those places. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Joshua captured all the cities from Kadesh Barnea to Gaza. He captured all the cities from Goshen<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Goshen The northeastern part of Egypt.</span></a> to Gibeon.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Joshua captured all these cities and their kings in one series of battles. He did this because the LORD, the God of Israel, was fighting for Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Then Joshua and all the Israelites returned to their camp at Gilgal. </div><ul class='tnav'>
