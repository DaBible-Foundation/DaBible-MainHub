<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 4</div><div class='s'>Jesus Talks to a Woman in Samaria </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard the report that he was making and baptizing more followers than John.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>(But really, Jesus himself did not baptize anyone; his followers baptized people for him.)  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So he left Judea and went back to Galilee.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>On the way to Galilee, he had to go through the country of Samaria. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>In Samaria Jesus came to the town called Sychar, which is near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Jacob’s well was there. Jesus was tired from his long trip, so he sat down beside the well. It was about noon.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>A Samaritan woman came to the well to get some water, and Jesus said to her, “Please give me a drink.”  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>This happened while his followers were in town buying some food. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The woman answered, “I am surprised that you ask me for a drink! You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman!” (Jews have nothing to do with Samaritans.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Jews have nothing to do with Samaritans Or “Jews don’t use things that Samaritans have used.”</span></a>) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “You don’t know what God can give you. And you don’t know who I am, the one who asked you for a drink. If you knew, you would have asked me, and I would have given you living water.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The woman said, “Sir, where will you get that living water? The well is very deep, and you have nothing to get water with.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob? He is the one who gave us this well. He drank from it himself, and his sons and all his animals drank from it too.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But anyone who drinks the water I give will never be thirsty again. The water I give people will be like a spring flowing inside them. It will bring them eternal life.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The woman said to Jesus, “Sir, give me this water. Then I will never be thirsty again and won’t have to come back here to get more water.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Jesus told her, “Go get your husband and come back.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The woman answered, “But I have no husband.” </div><div class='p'>Jesus said to her, “You are right to say you have no husband.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>That’s because, although you have had five husbands, the man you live with now is not your husband. That much was the truth.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The woman said, “Sir, I can see that you are a prophet.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> prophet A prophet often knows things that are hidden to other people.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain. But you Jews say that Jerusalem is the place where people must worship.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Jesus said, “Believe me, woman! The time is coming when you will not have to be in Jerusalem or on this mountain to worship the Father.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>You Samaritans worship something you don’t understand. We Jews understand what we worship, since salvation comes from the Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But the time is coming when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth. In fact, that time is now here. And these are the kind of people the Father wants to be his worshipers.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>God is spirit. So the people who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The woman said, “I know that the Messiah is coming.” (He is the one called Christ.) “When he comes, he will explain everything to us.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then Jesus said, “He is talking to you now—I am the Messiah.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Just then Jesus’ followers came back from town. They were surprised because they saw Jesus talking with a woman. But none of them asked, “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking with her?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then the woman left her water jar and went back to town. She told the people there,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>“A man told me everything I have ever done. Come see him. Maybe he is the Messiah.”  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>So the people left the town and went to see Jesus. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>While the woman was in town, Jesus’ followers were begging him, “Teacher, eat something!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But Jesus answered, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>So the followers asked themselves, “Did someone already bring him some food?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Jesus said, “My food is to do what the one who sent me wants me to do. My food is to finish the work that he gave me to do.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>When you plant, you always say, ‘Four more months to wait before we gather the grain.’ But I tell you, open your eyes, and look at the fields. They are ready for harvesting now.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Even now, the people who harvest the crop are being paid. They are gathering crops for eternal life. So now the people who plant can be happy together with those who harvest.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>It is true when we say, ‘One person plants, but another person harvests the crop.’  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>I sent you to harvest a crop that you did not work for. Others did the work, and you get the profit from their work.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Many of the Samaritan people in that town believed in Jesus. They believed because of what the woman had told them about him. She had told them, “He told me everything I have ever done.”  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>The Samaritans went to Jesus. They begged him to stay with them. So he stayed there two days.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Many more people became believers because of the things he said. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>The people said to the woman, “First we believed in Jesus because of what you told us. But now we believe because we heard him ourselves. We know now that he really is the one who will save the world.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Heals an Official’s Son </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 8:5–13; Lk. 7:1–10) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Two days later Jesus left and went to Galilee.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>(Jesus had said before that a prophet is not respected in his own country.)  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>When he arrived in Galilee, the people there welcomed him. They had been at the Passover festival in Jerusalem and had seen everything he did there. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Jesus went to visit Cana in Galilee again. Cana is where he had changed the water into wine. One of the king’s important officials lived in the city of Capernaum. This man’s son was sick.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>The man heard that Jesus had come from Judea and was now in Galilee. So he went to Jesus and begged him to come to Capernaum and heal his son, who was almost dead.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Jesus said to him, “You people must see miraculous signs and wonders before you will believe in me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>The king’s official said, “Sir, come before my little son dies.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “Go. Your son will live.” </div><div class='p'>The man believed what Jesus told him and went home.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>On the way home, the man’s servants came and met him. They said, “Your son is well.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>The man asked, “What time did my son begin to get well?” </div><div class='p'>They answered, “It was about one o’clock yesterday when the fever left him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>The father knew that one o’clock was the same time that Jesus had said, “Your son will live.” So the man and everyone in his house believed in Jesus. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>That was the second miraculous sign that Jesus did after coming from Judea to Galilee. </div><ul class='tnav'>
