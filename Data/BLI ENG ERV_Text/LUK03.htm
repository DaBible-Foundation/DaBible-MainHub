These men were under Caesar: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='li'>Pontius Pilate, the governor of Judea; </div><div class='li'>Herod, the ruler of Galilee; </div><div class='li'>Philip, Herod’s brother, the ruler of Iturea and Trachonitis; </div><div class='li'>Lysanias, the ruler of Abilene. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Annas and Caiaphas were the high priests. During this time, John, the son of Zechariah, was living in the desert, and he received a message from God.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So he went through the whole area around the Jordan River and told the people God’s message. He told them to be baptized to show that they wanted to change their lives, and then their sins would be forgiven.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>This is like the words written in the book of Isaiah the prophet: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“There is someone shouting in the desert: </div><div class='q'>‘Prepare the way for the Lord. </div><div class='q2'>Make the road straight for him. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Every valley will be filled, </div><div class='q2'>and every mountain and hill will be made flat. </div><div class='q'>Crooked roads will be made straight, </div><div class='q2'>and rough roads will be made smooth. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then everyone will see </div><div class='q2'>how God will save his people!’ ” <span class='rq'>Isaiah 40:3-5</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Crowds of people came to be baptized by John. But he said to them, “You are all snakes! Who warned you to run from God’s judgment that is coming?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Change your hearts! And show by your lives that you have changed. I know what you are about to say—‘but Abraham is our father!’ That means nothing. I tell you that God can make children for Abraham from these rocks!  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The ax is now ready to cut down the trees.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> trees Meaning the people who don’t obey God.

If you have food, share that too.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Even the tax collectors came to John. They wanted to be baptized. They said to him, “Teacher, what should we do?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He told them, “Don’t take more taxes from people than you have been ordered to collect.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The soldiers asked him, “What about us? What should we do?” </div><div class='p'>He said to them, “Don’t use force or lies to make people give you money. Be happy with the pay you get.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Everyone was hoping for the Messiah to come, and they wondered about John. They thought, “Maybe he is the Messiah.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>John’s answer to this was, “I baptize you in water, but there is someone coming later who is able to do more than I can. I am not good enough to be the slave who unties his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He will come ready to clean the grain.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> clean the grain Meaning that Jesus will separate the good people from those who are bad.</span></a> He will separate the good grain from the straw, and he will put the good part into his barn. Then he will burn the useless part with a fire that cannot be stopped.”  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>John said many other things like this to encourage the people to change, and he told them the Good News. </div><div class='s'>How John’s Work Later Ended </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>John criticized Herod the ruler for what he had done with Herodias, the wife of Herod’s brother, as well as for all the other bad things he had done.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So Herod added another bad thing to all his other wrongs: He put John in jail. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Is Baptized by John </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 3:13–17; Mk. 1:9–11) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>When all the people were being baptized, Jesus came and was baptized too. And while he was praying, the sky opened,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and the Holy Spirit came down on him. The Spirit looked like a real dove. Then a voice came from heaven and said, “You are my Son, the one I love.
