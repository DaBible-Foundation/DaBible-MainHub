But Balaam turned and looked toward the desert.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He looked out across the desert and saw all the Israelites. They were camped with the tribes in their different areas. Then the Spirit of God came on him,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>and he gave this message: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“This message is from Balaam son of Beor. </div><div class='q2'>I am speaking about things I see clearly. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>These are the words I heard from God. </div><div class='q2'>I saw what God All-Powerful<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> God All-Powerful Literally, “El Shaddai.” Also in verse 16.</span></a> showed me. </div><div class='q2'>I humbly tell what I clearly see. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“People of Jacob, your tents are beautiful! </div><div class='q2'>Israelites, your homes are beautiful! </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>You are like rows of palm trees planted by the streams. </div><div class='q2'>You are like gardens growing by the rivers. </div><div class='q'>You are like sweet-smelling bushes planted by the LORD. </div><div class='q2'>You are like cedar trees growing by the water. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>You will always have enough water, </div><div class='q2'>enough water for your seeds to grow. </div><div class='q'>Your king will be greater than King Agag. </div><div class='q2'>Your kingdom will be very great. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“God brought them out of Egypt. </div><div class='q2'>They are as strong as a wild ox. </div><div class='q'>They will defeat all their enemies. </div><div class='q2'>They will break their bones and shatter their arrows. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Israel is like a lion, </div><div class='q2'>curled up and lying down. </div><div class='q'>Yes, they are like a young lion, </div><div class='q2'>and no one wants to wake him! </div><div class='q'>Anyone who blesses you will be blessed. </div><div class='q2'>And anyone who curses you will have great troubles.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>When Balak heard this, he angrily struck his fist against his hand and said to Balaam, “I called you to come and curse my enemies.
