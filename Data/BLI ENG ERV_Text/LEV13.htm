If the sore looks like the disease of leprosy, the person must be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons, the priests.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The priest must look at the sore on the person’s skin. If the hair in the sore has become white, and if the sore seems deeper than the person’s skin, it is leprosy. When the priest has finished looking at the person, he must announce that the person is unclean. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>“Sometimes there is a white spot on a person’s skin that does not seem deeper than the skin. If that is true, the priest must separate that person from other people for seven days.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>On the seventh day the priest must look at the person again. If the priest sees that the sore has not changed and has not spread on the skin, he must separate the person for seven more days.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Seven days later the priest must look at the person again. If the sore has faded and has not spread on the skin, the priest must announce that the person is clean. The sore is only a rash. After washing the clothes, that person will be clean again. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>“But if the rash spreads over the skin after the person has shown himself to the priest to be made clean again, that person must come again to the priest.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The priest must look, and if the rash has spread, he must announce that the person is unclean. The disease is leprosy. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“Whoever has leprosy must be brought to the priest.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He must look at that person. If there is a white swelling on the skin, if the hair has become white, and if the skin looks raw in the swelling,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>it is leprosy that has been there for a long time. The priest must announce that the person is unclean. He does not have to wait until after a period of separation, because he already knows that the person is unclean. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>“Sometimes a skin disease will spread all over a person’s body, covering the skin from head to foot. The priest must look at that person’s whole body.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>If the priest sees that the skin disease covers the whole body and that it has turned all the skin white, the priest must announce that the person is clean.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But if the skin is raw, that person is not clean.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>When the priest sees the raw skin, he must announce that the person is unclean.

If the skin has become white, the person who had the infection is clean, and the priest must announce this. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>“Someone might get a boil on their skin that heals over.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then that boil might become a white swelling or a bright, white spot with red streaks in it. If this happens, the person must show that spot to the priest.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The priest must look at it. If the swelling is deeper than the skin, and the hair on it has become white, the priest must announce that the person is unclean. The spot is leprosy that has broken out from inside the boil.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But if the priest looks at the spot, and there are no white hairs in it, and the spot is not deeper than the skin but is faded, the priest must separate the person for seven days.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>If the spot spreads on the skin, the priest must announce that the person is unclean; it is an infection.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But if the bright spot stays in its place and does not spread, it is only the scar from the old boil. The priest must announce that the person is clean. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24-25&#160;</span>“Someone might get a burn on the skin. If the raw skin becomes a white spot or a white spot with red streaks in it, the priest must look at it. If that white spot seems to be deeper than the skin, and the hair at that spot has become white, it is leprosy that has broken out in the burn. The priest must announce that the person is unclean.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But if the priest looks at the spot, and there is no white hair in the bright spot, and the spot is not deeper than the skin but is faded, the priest must separate the person for seven days.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>On the seventh day, the priest must look at the person again. If the spot has spread on the skin, the priest must announce that the person is unclean. It is leprosy.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But if the bright spot has not spread on the skin but has faded, it is only a scar from the burn.

If the disease has not spread, and there are no yellow hairs growing in it, and the disease does not seem deeper than the skin,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>the person must shave.

If the disease has spread, the priest does not need to look for yellow hair. The person is unclean.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>But if the priest thinks that the disease has stopped, and black hair is growing in it, the disease has healed.
