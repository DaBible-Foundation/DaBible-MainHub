<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 13</div><div class='s'>Barnabas and Saul Given a Special Work </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>In the church at Antioch there were some prophets and teachers. They were Barnabas, Simeon (also called Niger), Lucius (from the city of Cyrene), Manaen (who had grown up with King Herod<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> King Herod Literally, “Herod the tetrarch.” See “Herod Agrippa I” in the Word List.</span></a>), and Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>These men were all serving the Lord and fasting when the Holy Spirit said to them, “Appoint Barnabas and Saul to do a special work for me. They are the ones I have chosen to do it.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So the church fasted and prayed. They laid their hands on Barnabas and Saul and sent them out. </div><div class='s'>Barnabas and Saul in Cyprus </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Barnabas and Saul were sent out by the Holy Spirit. They went to the city of Seleucia. Then they sailed from there to the island of Cyprus.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>When Barnabas and Saul came to the city of Salamis, they told the message of God in the Jewish synagogues. John Mark was with them to help. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>They went across the whole island to the city of Paphos. There they met a Jewish man named Barjesus who did magic. He was a false prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He always stayed close to Sergius Paulus, who was the governor and a very smart man. He invited Barnabas and Saul to come visit him, because he wanted to hear the message of God.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But the magician Elymas (as Barjesus was called in Greek) spoke against them, trying to stop the governor from believing in Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But Saul (also known as Paul), filled with the Holy Spirit, looked hard at Elymas  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and said, “You son of the devil, full of lies and all kinds of evil tricks! You are an enemy of everything that is right. Will you never stop trying to change the Lord’s truths into lies?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Now the Lord will touch you and you will be blind. For a time you will not be able to see anything—not even the light from the sun.” </div><div class='p'>Then everything became dark for Elymas. He walked around lost. He was trying to find someone to lead him by the hand.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>When the governor saw this, he believed. He was amazed at the teaching about the Lord. </div><div class='s'>Paul and Barnabas Go to Antioch in Pisidia </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Paul and the people with him sailed away from Paphos. They came to Perga, a city in Pamphylia. There John Mark left them and returned to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>They continued their trip from Perga and went to Antioch, a city near Pisidia. </div><div class='p'>On the Sabbath day they went into the Jewish synagogue and sat down.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The Law of Moses and the writings of the prophets were read. Then the leaders of the synagogue sent a message to Paul and Barnabas: “Brothers, if you have something to say that will help the people here, please speak.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Paul stood up, raised his hand to get their attention, and said, “People of Israel and all you others who worship the true God, please listen to me!  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The God of Israel chose our ancestors. And during the time our people lived in Egypt as foreigners, he made them great. Then he brought them out of that country with great power.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he was patient with them for 40 years in the desert.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>God destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan and gave their land to his people.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>All this happened in about 450 years. </div><div class='p'>“After this, God gave our people judges until the time of Samuel the prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then the people asked for a king. God gave them Saul, the son of Kish. Saul was from the tribe of Benjamin. He was king for 40 years.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>After God took Saul away, God made David their king. This is what God said about David: ‘David, the son of Jesse, is the kind of person who does what pleases me. He will do everything I want him to do.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>“As he promised, God has brought one of David’s descendants to Israel to be their Savior. That descendant is Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Before he came, John told all the people of Israel what they should do. He told them to be baptized to show they wanted to change their lives.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>When John was finishing his work, he said, ‘Who do you think I am? I am not the Messiah.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> the Messiah Literally, “I” (that is, “he” or “the one”), meaning the chosen one sent by God. Compare Jn. 1:20. See “Messiah” in the Word List.</span></a> He is coming later, and I am not worthy to be the slave who unties his sandals.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>“My brothers, sons in the family of Abraham, and you other people who also worship the true God, listen! The news about this salvation has been sent to us.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The Jews living in Jerusalem and their leaders did not realize that Jesus was the Savior. The words the prophets wrote about him were read every Sabbath day, but they did not understand. They condemned Jesus. When they did this, they made the words of the prophets come true.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>They could not find any real reason why Jesus should die, but they asked Pilate to kill him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>“These Jews did all the bad things that the Scriptures said would happen to Jesus. Then they took Jesus down from the cross and put him in a tomb.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But God raised him up from death!  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>After this, for many days, those who had gone with Jesus from Galilee to Jerusalem saw him. They are now his witnesses to our people. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>“We tell you the Good News about the promise God made to our ancestors.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>We are their descendants, and God has made this promise come true for us. God did this by raising Jesus from death. We also read about this in Psalm 2: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>‘You are my Son. </div><div class='q2'>Today I have become your Father.’ <span class='rq'>Psalm 2:7</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>God raised Jesus from death. Jesus will never go back to the grave and become dust. So God said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>‘I will give you the true and holy promises </div><div class='q2'>that I made to David.’ <span class='rq'>Isaiah 55:3</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>But in another Psalm it says, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>‘You will not let your Holy One rot in the grave.’ <span class='rq'>Psalm 16:10</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>“David did God’s will during the time he lived. Then he died and was buried like all his ancestors. And his body did rot in the grave!  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>But the one God raised from death did not rot in the grave.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38-39&#160;</span>Brothers, understand what we are telling you. You can have forgiveness of your sins through this Jesus. The Law of Moses could not free you from your sins. But you can be made right with God if you believe in Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>So be careful! Don’t let what the prophets said happen to you: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>‘Listen, you people who doubt! </div><div class='q2'>You can wonder, but then go away and die; </div><div class='q'>because during your time, </div><div class='q2'>I will do something that you will not believe. </div><div class='q'>You will not believe it, </div><div class='q2'>even if someone explains it to you!’ ” <span class='rq'>Habakkuk 1:5</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people asked them to come again on the next Sabbath day and tell them more about these things.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>After the meeting, many of the people followed Paul and Barnabas, including many Jews and people who had changed their religion to be like Jews and worship the true God. Paul and Barnabas encouraged them to continue trusting in God’s grace. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>On the next Sabbath day, almost all the people in the city came together to hear the word of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>When the Jews there saw all these people, they became very jealous. Shouting insults, they argued against everything Paul said.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>But Paul and Barnabas spoke very boldly. They said, “We had to tell God’s message to you Jews first, but you refuse to listen. You have made it clear that you are not worthy of having eternal life. So we will now go to those who are not Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>This is what the Lord told us to do: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>‘I have made you a light for the other nations, </div><div class='q2'>to show people all over the world the way to be saved.’ ” <span class='rq'>Isaiah 49:6</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>When the non-Jewish people heard Paul say this, they were happy. They gave honor to the message of the Lord, and many of them believed it. These were the ones chosen to have eternal life. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And so the message of the Lord was being told throughout the whole country.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>But the Jews there caused some of the important religious women and the leaders of the city to be angry and turn against Paul and Barnabas and throw them out of town.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>So Paul and Barnabas shook the dust off their feet.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> shook the dust off their feet A warning. It showed they were finished talking to these people.</span></a> Then they went to the city of Iconium.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>But the Lord’s followers in Antioch were happy and filled with the Holy Spirit. </div><ul class='tnav'>
