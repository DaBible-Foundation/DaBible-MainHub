The LORD has given me sorrow along with my pain. I am very tired. I am worn out because of my suffering. I cannot find rest.”  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Jeremiah, tell Baruch that this is what the LORD says: I will tear down what I have built, and I will pull up what I have planted. I will do that everywhere in Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Baruch, you are looking for great things for yourself. Don’t look for them, because I will make terrible things happen to all the people.’ This is what the LORD said. ‘You will have to go many places. But I will let you escape alive wherever you go.’ ” </div><ul class='tnav'>
