They found a plain in the land of Babylonia and stayed there to live.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then they said to each other, “Let’s make some bricks of clay and bake them in the fire.” Then they used these bricks as stones, and they used tar as mortar. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then the people said, “Let’s build ourselves a city and a tower that will reach to the sky.
