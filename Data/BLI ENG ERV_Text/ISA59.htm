He can hear you when you ask him for help.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>It is your sins that separate you from your God. He turns away from you when he sees them.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>That’s because your hands are covered with blood from the people you murdered. You tell lies and say evil things.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>You can’t be trusted, even in court. You lie about each other and depend on false arguments to win your cases. You create pain and produce wickedness.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>You hatch evil, like eggs from a poisonous snake. Anyone who eats the eggs will die. And if you break one of them open, a poisonous snake will come out. </div><div class='p'>Your lies are like spider webs.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>They cannot be used for clothes, and you cannot cover yourself with them. </div><div class='p'>Your hands are always busy sinning and hurting others.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Your feet run toward evil. You are always ready to kill innocent people. You think of nothing but evil. Everywhere you go you cause trouble and ruin.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>You don’t know how to live in peace. You don’t do what is right and fair. You are crooked, and anyone who lives like that will never know true peace. </div><div class='s'>Israel’s Sin Brings Trouble </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>All fairness and goodness is gone. </div><div class='q'>There is only darkness around us, </div><div class='q2'>so we must wait for the light. </div><div class='q'>We hope for a bright light, </div><div class='q2'>but all we have is darkness. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>We are like people without eyes. </div><div class='q2'>We walk into walls like blind people. </div><div class='q'>We stumble and fall as if it was night. </div><div class='q2'>Even in the daylight, we cannot see. </div><div class='q2'>At noontime, we fall like dead men. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>We are always complaining; </div><div class='q2'>we growl like bears and moan like doves. </div><div class='q'>We are waiting for justice, </div><div class='q2'>but there is none. </div><div class='q'>We are waiting to be saved, </div><div class='q2'>but salvation is still far away. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>That’s because we committed crimes against our God. </div><div class='q2'>Our own sins speak out against us. </div><div class='q'>We know we are guilty. </div><div class='q2'>We know we have sinned. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>We rebelled against the LORD </div><div class='q2'>and lied to him. </div><div class='q'>We turned away from our God </div><div class='q2'>and left him. </div><div class='q'>We planned to hurt others </div><div class='q2'>and to rebel against God. </div><div class='q'>From hearts filled with lies, </div><div class='q2'>we talked about it and made our plans. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>We pushed Justice away. </div><div class='q2'>Fairness stands off in the distance. </div><div class='q'>Truth has fallen in the streets. </div><div class='q2'>Goodness is not allowed in the city. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Loyalty is gone, </div><div class='q2'>and people who try to do good are robbed. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>The LORD looked and saw there was no justice. </div><div class='q2'>He did not like what he saw. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He did not see anyone speak up for the people. </div><div class='q2'>He was shocked to see that no one stood up for them. </div><div class='q'>So with his own power he saved them. </div><div class='q2'>His desire to do what is right gave him strength. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He put on the armor of goodness, </div><div class='q2'>the helmet of salvation, </div><div class='q'>the uniform of punishment, </div><div class='q2'>and the coat of strong love.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> strong love The Hebrew word means strong feelings like love, hate, anger, zeal, or jealousy.</span></a> </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He will give his enemies the punishment they deserve. </div><div class='q2'>They will feel his anger. </div><div class='q'>He will punish all his enemies. </div><div class='q2'>People along the coast will get the punishment they deserve. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>People from the west to the east will fear the LORD </div><div class='q2'>and respect his Glory. </div><div class='q'>He will come quickly, like a fast-flowing river </div><div class='q2'>driven by a wind<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> wind Or “spirit.”</span></a> from the LORD. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then a redeemer<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> redeemer Someone who sets a person free by paying their debt.</span></a> will come to Zion </div><div class='q2'>to save the people of Jacob who have turned away from sin. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The LORD says, “As for me, this is the agreement that I will make with these people.
