<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 32</div><div class='s'>Tribes East of the Jordan River </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The tribes of Reuben and Gad had many cattle. These people looked at the land near Jazer and Gilead. They saw that this land was good for their cattle.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>So the people from the tribes of Reuben and Gad came to Moses. They spoke to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3-4&#160;</span>They said, “We, your servants, have many cattle. And the land that the LORD let the people of Israel capture is good land for cattle. This land includes the area around Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sibmah,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Sibmah Or “Sebam.”</span></a> Nebo, and Beon.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>If it pleases you, we would like this land to be given to us. Don’t take us to the other side of the Jordan River.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Moses told the people from the tribes of Reuben and Gad, “Will you let your brothers go and fight while you settle here?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Why are you trying to discourage the Israelites? You will make them not want to cross the river and take the land that the LORD has given to them!  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Your fathers did the same thing to me. In Kadesh Barnea I sent spies to look at the land.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>These men went as far as Eshcol Valley. They saw the land, and they discouraged the Israelites. These men made the Israelites not want to go into the land that the LORD had given to them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The LORD became very angry with the people. He made this promise:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>‘None of the people who came from Egypt and are 20 years old or older will be allowed to see this land. I made a promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I promised to give this land to these people, but they did not really follow me.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Only Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun really followed the LORD!’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“The LORD was very angry with the Israelites. So he made the people stay in the desert for 40 years. He made them stay there until all the people who had sinned against the LORD were dead.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And now you are doing the same thing that your fathers did. You sinful people, do you want the LORD to be even more angry with his people?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>If you stop following the Lord, he will make Israel stay even longer in the desert. Then you will destroy all these people!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But the people from the tribes of Reuben and Gad went to Moses. They said, “We will build cities for our children and barns for our animals here.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then our children can be safe from the other people who live in this land. But we will gladly come and help the other Israelites. We will bring them to their land.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>We will not come back home until everyone in Israel has taken his part of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>We will not take any of the land west of the Jordan River. No, our part of the land is east of the Jordan River.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So Moses told them, “If you do all these things, this land will belong to you. But your soldiers must go before the LORD into battle.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Your soldiers must cross the Jordan River and be ready to fight for the LORD until he forces the enemy to leave.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>After the LORD helps us all take the land, you can go back home. Then the LORD and Israel will not think that you are guilty. And the LORD will let you have this land.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But if you don’t do these things, you will be sinning against the LORD. And know for sure that you will be punished for your sin.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Build cities for your children and barns for your animals. But then, you must do what you promised.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then the people from the tribes of Gad and Reuben said to Moses, “We are your servants. You are our master, so we will do what you say.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Our wives, children, and all our animals will stay in the cities of Gilead.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But we, your servants, will cross the Jordan River. We will march before the LORD into battle, as our master says.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So Moses, Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and all the leaders of the tribes of Israel heard them make that promise.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Moses said to them, “The people of Gad and Reuben will cross the Jordan River. They will march before the LORD into battle. They will help you take the land. And you will give the land of Gilead as their part of the country.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But if they do not cross the river with you ready to fight, they will not get any land on this side. They will get only a share of the land of Canaan with the rest of you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The people of Gad and Reuben answered, “We promise to do what the LORD commanded.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>We will cross the Jordan River and march before the LORD into the land of Canaan. And our part of the country is the land east of the Jordan River.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>So Moses gave that land to the people of Gad, to the people of Reuben, and to half the tribe of Manasseh. (Manasseh was Joseph’s son.) That land included the kingdom of Sihon the Amorite and the kingdom of King Og of Bashan and all the cities around that area. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>The people of Gad built the cities of Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Atroth Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Beth Nimrah, and Beth Haran. They built cities with strong walls, and they built barns for their animals. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>The people of Reuben built Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Nebo, Baal Meon, and Sibmah. They used the names of the cities that they rebuilt. But they changed the names of Nebo and Baal Meon. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>People from Makir’s family group went to Gilead.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gilead Here, this seems to refer to a city, perhaps Ramoth Gilead. But it might refer to the whole area. See Hos. 6:8.</span></a> (Makir was Manasseh’s son.) They defeated the city. They defeated the Amorites who lived there.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>So Moses gave Gilead to Makir from the tribe of Manasseh, and his family settled there.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Jair, from the family of Manasseh, defeated the small towns there. Then he called them Towns of Jair.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Nobah defeated Kenath and the small towns near it. Then he called that place by his own name. </div><ul class='tnav'>
