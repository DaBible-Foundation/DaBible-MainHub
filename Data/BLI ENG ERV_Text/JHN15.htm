All the dead branches like that are gathered up, thrown into the fire and burned.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Stay joined together with me, and follow my teachings. If you do this, you can ask for anything you want, and it will be given to you.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Show that you are my followers by producing much fruit.

In the same way, if you obey my commands, I will continue to love you.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I have told you these things so that you can have the true happiness that I have.
