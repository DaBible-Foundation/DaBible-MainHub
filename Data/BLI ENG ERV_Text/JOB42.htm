He said, “I am angry with you and your two friends, because you did not tell the truth about me, as my servant Job did.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So now, Eliphaz, get seven bulls and seven rams. Take them to my servant Job. Kill them and offer them as a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will answer his prayer. Then I will not give you the punishment you deserve. You should be punished, because you were very foolish. You did not say what is right about me, as my servant Job did.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So Eliphaz from Teman, Bildad from Shuah, and Zophar from Naamah obeyed the LORD. Then the LORD answered Job’s prayer. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Job prayed for his friends, and the LORD made Job successful again. The LORD gave him twice as much as he had before.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then all his brothers and sisters and all the people who knew him before came to his house. They all ate a big meal with him. They comforted him and were sorry that the LORD had brought him so much trouble. Each person gave Job a piece of silver and a gold ring. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The LORD blessed Job with even more than he had in the beginning. Job got 14,000 sheep, 6000 camels, 2000 oxen, and 1000 female donkeys.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He also got seven sons and three daughters.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He named the first daughter Jemimah and the second daughter Keziah. He named the third daughter Keren Happuch.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Job’s daughters were among the most beautiful women in all the country. And, like their brothers, they each got a share of their father’s property.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> And … property Usually a person’s property was divided only among the sons, but here, even Job’s daughters got part of his property.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So Job lived for 140 years more. He lived to see his children, his grandchildren, his great-grandchildren, and his great-great-grandchildren.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Job lived to be a very old man who had lived a good, long life. </div><ul class='tnav'>
