<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 6</div><div class='s'>Jesus Goes to His Hometown </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 13:53–58; Lk. 4:16–30) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Jesus left and went back to his hometown. His followers went with him.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>On the Sabbath day Jesus taught in the synagogue, and many people heard him. They were amazed and said, “Where did this man get this teaching? How did he get such wisdom? Who gave it to him? And where did he get the power to do miracles?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Isn’t he just the carpenter we know—Mary’s son, the brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And don’t his sisters still live here in town?” So they had a problem accepting him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then Jesus said to them, “People everywhere give honor to a prophet, except in his own town, with his own people, or in his home.”  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Jesus was not able to do any miracles there except the healing of some sick people by laying his hands on them.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He was surprised that the people there had no faith. Then he went to other villages in that area and taught. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Sends His Apostles on a Mission </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 10:1, 5–15; Lk. 9:1–6) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Jesus called his twelve apostles together. He sent them out in groups of two and gave them power over evil spirits.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>This is what he told them: “Take nothing for your trip except a stick for walking. Take no bread, no bag, and no money.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>You can wear sandals, but don’t take extra clothes.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>When you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>If any town refuses to accept you or refuses to listen to you, then leave that town and shake the dust off your feet<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> shake the dust off your feet A warning. It would show that they were finished talking to these people.</span></a> as a warning to them.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The apostles left and went to other places. They talked to the people and told them to change their hearts and lives.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>They forced many demons out of people and put olive oil on<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> put olive oil on Olive oil was used like a medicine.</span></a> many who were sick and healed them. </div><div class='s'>Herod Thinks Jesus Is John the Baptizer </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 14:1–12; Lk. 9:7–9) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>King Herod heard about Jesus, because Jesus was now famous. Some people said, “He is John the Baptizer. He must have risen from death, and that is why he can do these miracles.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Other people said, “He is Elijah.” </div><div class='p'>And others said, “He is a prophet. He is like the prophets who lived long ago.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Herod heard these things about Jesus. He said, “I killed John by cutting off his head. Now he has been raised from death!” </div><div class='s'>How John the Baptizer Was Killed </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Herod himself had ordered his soldiers to arrest John and put him in prison. Herod did this to please his wife Herodias. She had been married to Herod’s brother Philip, but then Herod married her.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>John told Herod, “It is not right for you to be married to your brother’s wife.”  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So Herodias hated John. She wanted him dead, but she was not able to persuade Herod to kill him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Herod was afraid to kill John, because he knew that he was a good and holy man. So he protected him. He liked listening to John, although what John said left him with so many questions. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then the right time came for Herodias to cause John’s death. It happened on Herod’s birthday. Herod gave a dinner party for the most important government leaders, the commanders of his army, and the most important people in Galilee.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The daughter of Herodias came to the party and danced. When she danced, Herod and the people eating with him were very pleased. </div><div class='p'>So King Herod said to the girl, “I will give you anything you want.”  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He promised her, “Anything you ask for I will give to you—even half of my kingdom.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The girl went to her mother and asked, “What should I ask King Herod to give me?” </div><div class='p'>Her mother answered, “Ask for the head of John the Baptizer.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So right then the girl went back in to the king. She said to him, “Please give me the head of John the Baptizer. Bring it to me now on a plate.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>King Herod was very sad, but he didn’t want to break the promise he had made to her in front of his guests.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>So he sent a soldier to cut off John’s head and bring it to him. The soldier went and cut off John’s head in the prison.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>He brought the head back on a plate and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>John’s followers heard about what happened, so they came and got John’s body and put it in a tomb. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Feeds More Than 5000 </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 14:13–21; Lk. 9:10–17; Jn. 6:1–14) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The apostles Jesus had sent out came back to him. They gathered around him and told him about all they had done and taught.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Jesus and his followers were in a very busy place. There were so many people that he and his followers did not even have time to eat. He said to them, “Come with me. We will go to a quiet place to be alone. There we will get some rest.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>So Jesus and his followers went away alone. They went in a boat to a place where no one lived.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But many people saw them leave and knew who they were. So people from every town ran to the place where they were going and got there before Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>As Jesus stepped out of the boat, he saw a large crowd waiting. He felt sorry for them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd to care for them. So he taught the people many things. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>It was now very late in the day. Jesus’ followers came to him and said, “No one lives around here, and it is already very late.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>So send the people away. They need to go to the farms and towns around here to buy some food to eat.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>But Jesus answered, “You give them some food to eat.” </div><div class='p'>They said to Jesus, “We can’t buy enough bread to feed all these people. We would all have to work a month to earn enough to buy that much bread!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Jesus asked them, “How many loaves of bread do you have now? Go and see.” </div><div class='p'>They counted their loaves of bread. They came to Jesus and said, “We have five loaves of bread and two fish.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Then Jesus said to them, “Tell everyone to sit in groups on the green grass.”  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>So all the people sat in groups. There were about 50 or 100 people in each group. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Jesus took the five loaves and two fish. He looked up to the sky and thanked God for the food. Then he broke the bread into pieces, which he gave to his followers to distribute to the people. Then he divided the two fish among everyone there. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>They all ate until they were full.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>After they finished eating, the followers filled twelve baskets with the pieces of bread and fish that were left.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>There were about 5000 men there who ate. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Walks on Water </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 14:22–33; Jn. 6:16–21) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Then Jesus told the followers to get into the boat. He told them to go to the other side of the lake to Bethsaida. He said he would come later. He stayed there to tell everyone they could go home.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>After he said goodbye to them, he went up into the hills to pray. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>That night, the boat was still in the middle of the lake. Jesus was alone on the land.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>He saw the boat far away on the lake. And he saw the followers working hard to row the boat. The wind was blowing against them. Sometime between three and six o’clock in the morning, Jesus went out to the boat, walking on the water. He continued walking until he was almost past the boat.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>But the followers saw Jesus walking on the water. They thought he was a ghost, and they started screaming.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>It scared them all to see him. But he spoke to them and said, “Don’t worry! It’s me! Don’t be afraid.”  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>When he got into the boat with the followers, the wind stopped. The followers were completely amazed.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>They could not believe what happened. It was like the miracle he did with the bread. They still didn’t understand what that meant. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Heals Many Sick People </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 14:34–36) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>Jesus and his followers went across the lake and came to shore at Gennesaret. They tied the boat there.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>When they were out of the boat, the people there saw Jesus. They knew who he was,  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>so they ran to tell others throughout that area. They brought sick people on mats to every place Jesus went.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Jesus went into towns, cities, and farms around that area. And every place he went, the people brought sick people to the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch any part of his coat. And all those who touched him were healed. </div><ul class='tnav'>
