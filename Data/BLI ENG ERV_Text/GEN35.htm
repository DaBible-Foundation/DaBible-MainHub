<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 35</div><div class='s'>Jacob in Bethel </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>God said to Jacob, “Go to the town of Bethel.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Bethel A town in Israel. This name means “God’s house.”</span></a> That is where I appeared to you when you were running away from your brother Esau. Live there and make an altar to honor me as El,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> El A Hebrew name for God.</span></a> the God who appeared to you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>So Jacob told his family and all the other people with him, “Destroy all these foreign gods that you have. Make yourselves pure. Put on clean clothes.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>We will leave here and go to Bethel. There I will build an altar to the God who has always helped me during times of trouble. He has been with me wherever I have gone.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>So the people gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had, and they gave him all the rings they were wearing in their ears. He buried everything under an oak tree near the town called Shechem. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then Jacob and his sons left that place. The people in the surrounding cities wanted to follow and kill them, but God filled them with such great fear that they did not go after them.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So Jacob and his people went to Luz, which is now called Bethel. It is in the land of Canaan.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Jacob built an altar there. He named the place “El Bethel.”<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> El Bethel A name that means “the God of Bethel.”</span></a> Jacob chose this name because that is the place where God first appeared to him when he was running from his brother. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died there. They buried her under the oak tree at Bethel. They named that place Allon Bacuth.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Allon Bacuth This name means “the oak tree of sadness.”</span></a> </div><div class='s'>Jacob’s New Name </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>When Jacob came back from Paddan Aram, God appeared to him again. God blessed Jacob  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and said to him, “Your name is Jacob, but I will change that name. You will no longer be called Jacob. Your new name will be Israel.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Israel This name might mean “he fights for God,” “he fights with God,” or “God fights.”</span></a>” So God named him Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>God said to him, “I am God All-Powerful,<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> God All-Powerful Literally, “El Shaddai.”</span></a> and I give you this blessing: Have many children and grow into a great nation. Other nations and other kings will come out of you.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I gave Abraham and Isaac some special land. Now I give the land to you and to all your people who will live after you.”  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then God left that place.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14-15&#160;</span>Jacob set up a memorial stone there. He made the rock holy by pouring wine and oil on it. This was a special place because God spoke to Jacob there, and Jacob named the place Bethel. </div><div class='s'>Rachel Dies Giving Birth </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Jacob and his group left Bethel. Before they came to Ephrath, Rachel began giving birth to her baby.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>She was having a lot of trouble with this birth. She was in great pain. When her nurse saw this, she said, “Don’t be afraid, Rachel. You are giving birth to another son.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Rachel died while giving birth to the son. Before dying, she named the boy Benoni.<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Benoni This name means “son of my suffering.”</span></a> But Jacob called him Benjamin.<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Benjamin This name means “right-hand” or “favorite son.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Rachel was buried on the road to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Jacob put a special rock on Rachel’s grave to honor her. That special rock is still there today.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then Israel continued his journey. He camped just south of Eder tower.<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Eder tower Or “Migdal Eder.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Israel stayed there for a short time.
