<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 26</div><div class='s'>Paul Before King Agrippa </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Agrippa said to Paul, “You may now speak to defend yourself.” Paul raised his hand to get their attention and began to speak.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He said, “King Agrippa, I feel fortunate that I can stand here before you today and answer all the charges these Jews have made against me.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I am very happy to talk to you, because you know so much about all the Jewish customs and the things the Jews argue about. Please listen to me patiently. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>“All the Jews know about my whole life. They know the way I lived from the beginning in my own country and later in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>These Jews have known me for a long time. If they want to, they can tell you that I was a good Pharisee. And the Pharisees obey the laws of the Jewish religion more carefully than any other group.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Now I am on trial because I hope for the promise that God made to our fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>This is the promise that all the twelve tribes of our people hope to receive. For this hope the Jews serve God day and night. My king, the Jews have accused me because I hope for this same promise.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Why do you people think it is impossible for God to raise people from death? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“I used to think that I should do everything I could against Jesus from Nazareth.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And that’s what I did, beginning in Jerusalem. The leading priests gave me the authority to put many of God’s people in jail. And when they were being killed, I agreed that it was a good thing.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I visited all the synagogues and punished them, trying to make them curse<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> curse Literally, “blaspheme,” the same as saying they did not believe in Jesus.</span></a> Jesus. My anger against these people was so strong that I went to other cities to find them and punish them. </div><div class='s'>Paul Tells About Seeing Jesus </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>“One time the leading priests gave me permission and the authority to go to the city of Damascus.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>On the way there, at noon, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun. It shined all around me and those traveling with me.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>We all fell to the ground. Then I heard a voice talking to me in Aramaic. The voice said, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? You are only hurting yourself by fighting me.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>“I said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ </div><div class='p'>“The Lord said, ‘I am Jesus. I am the one you are persecuting.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Stand up! I have chosen you to be my servant. You will tell people about me—what you have seen today and what I will show you. This is why I have come to you.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I will keep you safe from your own people and from the non-Jewish people, the ones I am sending you to.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>You will make them able to understand the truth. They will turn away from darkness to the light. They will turn away from the power of Satan, and they will turn to God. Then their sins can be forgiven, and they can be given a place among God’s people—those who have been made holy by believing in me.’ ” </div><div class='s'>Paul Tells About His Work </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Paul continued speaking: “King Agrippa, after I had this vision from heaven, I obeyed it.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>I began telling people to change their hearts and lives and turn back to God. And I told them to do what would show that they had really changed. I went first to people in Damascus. Then I went to Jerusalem and to every part of Judea and told the people there. I also went to the non-Jewish people. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>“This is why the Jews grabbed me and were trying to kill me at the Temple.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But God helped me, and he is still helping me today. With God’s help I am standing here today and telling all people what I have seen. But I am saying nothing new. I am saying only what Moses and the prophets said would happen.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>They said that the Messiah would die and be the first to rise from death. They said that he would bring the light of God’s saving truth<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> bring … truth Literally, “proclaim light.”</span></a> to the Jewish people and to the non-Jewish people.” </div><div class='s'>Paul Tries to Persuade Agrippa </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>While Paul was still defending himself, Festus shouted, “Paul, you are out of your mind! Too much study has made you crazy.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Paul said, “Most Honorable Festus, I am not crazy. What I am saying is true. It all makes perfect sense.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>King Agrippa knows about all this, and I can speak freely to him. I know that he has heard about these things, because they happened where everyone could see them.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>King Agrippa, do you believe what the prophets wrote? I know you believe!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>King Agrippa said to Paul, “Do you think you can persuade me to become a ‘Christ-follower’ so easily?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Paul said, “It is not important if it is easy or if it is hard. I pray to God that not only you but that everyone listening to me today could be saved and be just like me—except for these chains I have!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>King Agrippa, Governor Festus, Bernice, and all the people sitting with them stood up  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>and left the room. They were talking to each other. They said, “This man has done nothing worthy of being put to death or even put in jail.”  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Agrippa said to Festus, “We could let him go free, but he has asked to see Caesar.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
