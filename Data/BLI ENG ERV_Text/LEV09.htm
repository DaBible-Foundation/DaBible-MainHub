<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='s'>God Accepts the Priests </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>On the eighth day, Moses called for Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He said to Aaron, “Take a bull and a ram. There must be nothing wrong with them. The bull will be a sin offering, and the ram will be a burnt offering. Offer these animals to the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Tell the Israelites, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering, and take a calf and a lamb for a burnt offering. The calf and the lamb must each be one year old. There must be nothing wrong with them.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Take a bull and a ram for fellowship offerings. Take these animals and a grain offering mixed with oil for an offering to the LORD. Do this because the LORD will appear to you today.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So all the people came to the Meeting Tent. They all brought the things that Moses had commanded. All the people stood before the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Moses said, “You must do what the LORD commanded. Then the Glory of the LORD will appear to you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then Moses told Aaron: “Go do what the LORD commanded. Go to the altar and offer sin offerings and burnt offerings. Do what will make you and the people pure. Take the people’s sacrifices and make them pure.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So Aaron went to the altar. He killed the bull for the sin offering. This sin offering was for himself.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then the sons of Aaron brought the blood to Aaron. Aaron put his finger in the blood and put it on the corners of the altar. Then he poured out the blood at the base of the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He took the fat, the kidneys, and the fat part of the liver from the sin offering. He burned them on the altar just as the LORD had commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then Aaron burned the meat and skin on a fire outside the camp. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Next, Aaron killed the animal for the burnt offering. His sons brought the blood to him, and he sprinkled the blood around on the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Aaron’s sons gave the pieces and head of the burnt offering to Aaron, and he burned them on the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He also washed the inner parts and the legs of the burnt offering and burned them on the altar. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then Aaron brought the people’s offering. He killed the goat of the sin offering that was for the people. He offered the goat for sin, like the earlier sin offering.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He brought the burnt offering and offered it, just as the Lord had commanded.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He brought the grain offering to the altar. He took a handful of the grain and put it on the altar beside that morning’s daily sacrifice. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Aaron also killed the bull and the ram that were the fellowship offerings from the people. His sons brought the blood to him, and he sprinkled this blood around on the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Aaron’s sons also brought him the fat of the bull and the ram. They brought the fat tail, the fat covering the inner parts, the kidneys, and the fat part of the liver.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Aaron’s sons put these fat parts on the breasts of the bull and the ram. Aaron burned them on the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>He lifted the breasts and the gift of the right thigh to show he was offering them before the LORD, just as Moses had commanded. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them. After he finished offering the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the fellowship offerings, he came down from the altar. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Moses and Aaron went into the Meeting Tent. They came out and blessed the people. Then the Glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Fire came out from the LORD and burned the burnt offering and fat on the altar. When all the people saw this, they shouted with joy and then bowed to the ground to show their respect. </div><ul class='tnav'>
