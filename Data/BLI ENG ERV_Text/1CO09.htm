<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='s'>Rights That Paul Has Not Used </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>I am a free man. I am an apostle. I have seen Jesus our Lord. You people are an example of my work in the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Others may not accept me as an apostle, but surely you do. You are proof that I am an apostle in the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Some people want to judge me. So this is the answer I give them:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>We have the right to eat and drink, don’t we?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>We have the right to bring a believing wife with us when we travel, don’t we? The other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Peter all do this.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And are Barnabas and I the only ones who must work to earn our living?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>No soldier ever serves in the army and pays his own salary. No one ever plants a vineyard without eating some of the grapes himself. No one takes care of a flock of sheep without drinking some of the milk himself. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>These aren’t just my own thoughts. God’s law says the same thing.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Yes, it is written in the Law of Moses: “When a work animal is being used to separate grain, don’t keep it from eating the grain.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Deut. 25:4.</span></a> When God said this, was he thinking only about work animals? No.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He was really talking about us. Yes, that was written for us. The one who plows and the one who separates the grain should both expect to get some of the grain for their work.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>We planted spiritual seed among you, so we should be able to harvest from you some things for this life. Surely that is not asking too much.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Others have this right to get things from you. So surely we have this right too. But we don’t use this right. No, we endure everything ourselves so that we will not stop anyone from obeying the Good News of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Surely you know that those who work at the Temple get their food from the Temple. And those who serve at the altar get part of what is offered at the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>It is the same with those who have the work of telling the Good News. The Lord has commanded that those who tell the Good News should get their living from this work. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But I have not used any of these rights, and I am not trying to get anything from you. That is not my purpose for writing this. I would rather die than to have someone take away what for me is a great source of pride.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>It’s not my work of telling the Good News that gives me any reason to boast. That is my duty—something I must do. If I don’t tell people the Good News, I am in real trouble.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If I did it because it was my own choice, I would deserve to be paid. But I have no choice. I must tell the Good News. So I am only doing the duty that was given to me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>So what do I get for doing it? My reward is that when I tell people the Good News I can offer it to them for free and not use the rights that come with doing this work. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I am free. I belong to no other person, but I make myself a slave to everyone. I do this to help save as many people as I can.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>To the Jews I became like a Jew so that I could help save Jews. I myself am not ruled by the law, but to those who are ruled by the law I became like someone who is ruled by the law. I did this to help save those who are ruled by the law.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>To those who are without the law I became like someone who is without the law. I did this to help save those who are without the law. (But really, I am not without God’s law—I am ruled by the law of Christ.)  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>To those who are weak, I became weak so that I could help save them. I have become all things to all people. I did this so that I could save people in any way possible.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>I do all this to make the Good News known. I do it so that I can share in the blessings of the Good News. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>You know that in a race all the runners run, but only one runner gets the prize. So run like that. Run to win!  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>All who compete in the games use strict training. They do this so that they can win a prize—one that doesn’t last. But our prize is one that will last forever.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>So I run like someone who has a goal. I fight like a boxer who is hitting something, not just the air.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>It is my own body I fight to make it do what I want. I do this so that I won’t miss getting the prize myself after telling others about it. </div><ul class='tnav'>
