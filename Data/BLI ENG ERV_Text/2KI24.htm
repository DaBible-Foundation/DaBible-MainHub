Jehoiakim served Nebuchadnezzar for three years. Then Jehoiakim turned against Nebuchadnezzar and broke away from his rule.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The LORD sent groups of Babylonians, Arameans, Moabites, and Ammonites to fight against Jehoiakim. He sent them to destroy Judah. This happened just as the LORD had said. He used his servants the prophets to say those things. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The LORD commanded this to happen to Judah. In this way he would remove them from his sight. He did this because of all the sins that Manasseh committed.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He did this because Manasseh killed many innocent people and filled Jerusalem with their blood. The LORD would not forgive these sins. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The other things that Jehoiakim did are written in the book, <span class='bk'>The History of the Kings of Judah</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Jehoiakim died and was buried with his ancestors. His son Jehoiachin became the new king after him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The king of Babylon captured all the land between the Brook of Egypt and the Euphrates River.
