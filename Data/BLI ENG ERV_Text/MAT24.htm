But his followers came to him to show him the Temple’s buildings.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He asked them, “Are you looking at these buildings? The fact is, they will be destroyed. Every stone will be thrown down to the ground. Not one stone will be left on another.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Later, Jesus was sitting at a place on the Mount of Olives. The followers came to be alone with him. They said, “Tell us when these things will happen. And what will happen to prepare us for your coming and the end of time?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “Be careful! Don’t let anyone fool you.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Many people will come and use my name. They will say, ‘I am the Messiah.’ And they will fool many people.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>You will hear about wars that are being fought. And you will hear stories about other wars beginning. But don’t be afraid. These things must happen before the end comes.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Nations will fight against other nations. Kingdoms will fight against other kingdoms. There will be times when there is no food for people to eat. And there will be earthquakes in different places.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>These things are only the beginning of troubles, like the first pains of a woman giving birth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“Then you will be arrested and handed over to be punished and killed. People all over the world will hate you because you believe in me.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>During that time many believers will lose their faith. They will turn against each other and hate each other.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Many false prophets will come and cause many people to believe things that are wrong.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>There will be so much more evil in the world that the love of most believers will grow cold.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But the one who remains faithful to the end will be saved.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the Good News I have shared about God’s kingdom will be told throughout the world. It will be spread to every nation. Then the end will come. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>“Daniel the prophet spoke about ‘the terrible thing that causes destruction.’<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> ‘the terrible thing … destruction’ See Dan. 9:27; 11:31; 12:11.</span></a> You will see this terrible thing standing in the holy place.” (You who read this should understand what it means.)  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>“The people in Judea at that time should run away to the mountains.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They should run away without wasting time to stop for anything. If they are on the roof of their house, they must not go down to get anything out of the house.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>If they are in the field, they must not go back to get a coat. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>“During that time it will be hard for women who are pregnant or have small babies!  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Pray that it will not be winter or a Sabbath day when these things happen and you have to run away,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>because it will be a time of great trouble. There will be more trouble than has ever happened since the beginning of the world.
