Do something shameful, and they will have no respect for you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Words from wise people are like water bubbling up from a deep well—the well of wisdom. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>You must be fair in judging others. It is wrong to favor the guilty and rob the innocent of justice. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Fools say things to start arguments. They are just asking for a beating. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Fools hurt themselves when they speak. Their own words trap them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>People love to hear gossip.
