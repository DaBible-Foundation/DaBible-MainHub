The man bowed down before Jesus and said, “Lord, you have the power to heal me if you want.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Jesus touched the man. He said, “I want to heal you. Be healed!” Immediately the man was healed from his leprosy.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then Jesus said to him, “Don’t tell anyone about what happened. But go and let the priest look at you.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> let the priest look at you The Law of Moses said a priest must decide when a person with leprosy was well.</span></a> And offer the gift that Moses commanded for people who are made well. This will show everyone that you are healed.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Heals an Officer’s Servant </div><div class='r'>(Lk. 7:1–10; Jn. 4:43–54) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Jesus went to the city of Capernaum. When he entered the city, an army officer came to him and begged for help.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The officer said, “Lord, my servant is very sick at home in bed. He can’t move his body and has much pain.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Jesus said to the officer, “I will go and heal him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The officer answered, “Lord, I am not good enough for you to come into my house. You need only to give the order, and my servant will be healed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I know this, because I understand authority. There are people who have authority over me, and I have soldiers under my authority. I tell one soldier, ‘Go,’ and he goes. I tell another soldier, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and my servant obeys me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. He said to those who were with him, “The truth is, this man has more faith than anyone I have found, even in Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Many people will come from the east and from the west. These people will sit and eat with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in God’s kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And those who should have the kingdom will be thrown out. They will be thrown outside into the darkness, where people will cry and grind their teeth with pain.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then Jesus said to the officer, “Go home. Your servant will be healed the way you believed he would.” Right then his servant was healed. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Heals Many People </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 1:29–34; Lk. 4:38–41) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Jesus went to Peter’s house.

Then she stood up and began to serve him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>That evening people brought to Jesus many people who had demons inside them. He spoke and the demons left the people. He healed all those who were sick.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So Jesus made clear the full meaning of what Isaiah the prophet said: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“He took away our diseases </div><div class='q2'>and carried away our sicknesses.” <span class='rq'>Isaiah 53:4</span> </div><div class='s'>Following Jesus </div><div class='r'>(Lk. 9:57–62) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he told his followers to go to the other side of the lake.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, “Teacher, I will follow you any place you go.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Jesus said to him, “The foxes have holes to live in.

The waves covered the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The followers went to him and woke him. They said, “Lord, save us! We will drown!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “Why are you afraid?

There, two men who had demons inside them came to him. They lived in the burial caves and were so dangerous that no one could use the road by those caves.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>They came to Jesus and shouted, “What do you want with us, Son of God? Did you come here to punish us before the right time?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Near that place there was a large herd of pigs feeding.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The demons begged Jesus, “If you make us leave these men, please send us into that herd of pigs.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Jesus said to them, “Go!” So the demons left the men and went into the pigs. Then the whole herd of pigs ran down the hill into the lake, and all were drowned.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>The men who had the work of caring for the pigs ran away. They went into town and told the people everything that happened, especially about the men who had the demons.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then the whole town went out to see Jesus.
