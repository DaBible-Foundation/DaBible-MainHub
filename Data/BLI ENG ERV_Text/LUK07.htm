<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 7</div><div class='s'>Jesus Heals an Officer’s Servant </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 8:5–13; Jn. 4:43–54) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Jesus finished saying all these things to the people. Then he went into Capernaum.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>In Capernaum there was an army officer. He had a servant who was very sick; he was near death. The officer loved the servant very much.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>When he heard about Jesus, he sent some older Jewish leaders to him. He wanted the men to ask Jesus to come and save the life of his servant.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The men went to Jesus. They begged Jesus to help the officer. They said, “This officer is worthy to have your help.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>He loves our people and he built the synagogue for us.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So Jesus went with them. He was coming near the officer’s house when the officer sent friends to say, “Lord, you don’t need to do anything special for me. I am not good enough for you to come into my house.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>That is why I did not come to you myself. You need only to give the order, and my servant will be healed.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I know this because I am a man under the authority of other men. And I have soldiers under my authority. I tell one soldier, ‘Go,’ and he goes. And I tell another soldier, ‘Come,’ and he comes. And I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and my servant obeys me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. He turned to the people following him and said, “I tell you, this is the most faith I have seen anywhere, even in Israel.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The group that was sent to Jesus went back to the house. There they found that the servant was healed. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Brings a Woman’s Son Back to Life </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The next day Jesus and his followers went to a town called Nain. A big crowd was traveling with them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>When Jesus came near the town gate, he saw some people carrying a dead body. It was the only son of a woman who was a widow. Walking with her were many other people from the town.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>When the Lord saw the woman, he felt very sorry for her and said, “Don’t cry.”  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He walked to the open coffin and touched it. The men who were carrying the coffin stopped. Jesus spoke to the dead son: “Young man, I tell you, get up!”  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then the boy sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Everyone was filled with fear. They began praising God and said, “A great prophet is here with us!” and “God is taking care of his people.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>This news about Jesus spread all over Judea and to all the other places around there. </div><div class='s'>John Sends Men to Ask Jesus a Question </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 11:2–19) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>John’s followers told him about all these things. John called for two of his followers.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>He sent them to the Lord to ask, “Are you the one we heard was coming, or should we wait for someone else?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So the men came to Jesus. They said, “John the Baptizer sent us to you with this question: ‘Are you the one who is coming, or should we wait for someone else?’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Right then Jesus healed many people of their sicknesses and diseases. He healed those who had evil spirits and made many who were blind able to see again.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then he said to John’s followers, “Go tell John what you have seen and heard: The blind can see. The crippled can walk. People with leprosy are healed. The deaf can hear. The dead are brought back to life. And the Good News is being told to the poor.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Great blessings belong to those who don’t have a problem accepting me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>When John’s followers left, Jesus began talking to the people about John: “What did you people go out into the desert to see? Someone who is weak, like a stem of grass<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> stem of grass Literally, “reed.”</span></a> blowing in the wind?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Really, what did you expect to see? Someone dressed in fine clothes? Of course not. People who wear fancy clothes and live in luxury are all in kings’ palaces.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>So what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, John is a prophet. But I tell you, he is more than that.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>This Scripture was written about him: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>‘Listen! I will send my messenger ahead of you. </div><div class='q2'>He will prepare the way for you.’ <span class='rq'>Malachi 3:1</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>I tell you, no one ever born is greater than John. But even the least important person in God’s kingdom is greater than John.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>(When the people heard this, they all agreed that God’s teaching was good. Even the tax collectors agreed. These were the people who were baptized by John.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But the Pharisees and experts in the law refused to accept God’s plan for themselves; they did not let John baptize them.) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>“What shall I say about the people of this time? What can I compare them to? What are they like?  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>They are like children sitting in the marketplace. One group of children calls to the other children and says, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>‘We played flute music for you, </div><div class='q2'>but you did not dance; </div><div class='q'>we sang a sad song, </div><div class='q2'>but you did not cry.’ </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>John the Baptizer came and did not eat the usual food or drink wine. And you say, ‘He has a demon inside him.’  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>The Son of Man came eating and drinking. And you say, ‘Look at him! He eats too much and drinks too much wine! He is a friend of tax collectors and other sinners!’  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>But wisdom is shown to be right by those who accept it.” </div><div class='s'>Simon the Pharisee </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to eat with him. Jesus went into the Pharisee’s house and took a place at the table. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>There was a sinful woman in that town. She knew that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee’s house. So the woman brought some expensive perfume in an alabaster jar.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>She stood at Jesus’ feet, crying. Then she began to wash his feet with her tears. She dried his feet with her hair. She kissed his feet many times and rubbed them with the perfume. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>When the Pharisee who asked Jesus to come to his house saw this, he thought to himself, “If this man were a prophet,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> prophet A prophet often knows things that are hidden to other people.</span></a> he would know that the woman who is touching him is a sinner!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>In response, Jesus said to the Pharisee, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” </div><div class='p'>Simon said, “Let me hear it, Teacher.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Jesus said, “There were two men. Both men owed money to the same banker. One man owed him 500 silver coins. The other man owed him 50 silver coins.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>The men had no money, so they could not pay their debt. But the banker told the men that they did not have to pay him. Which one of those two men will love him more?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Simon answered, “I think it would be the one who owed him the most money.” </div><div class='p'>Jesus said to him, “You are right.”  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? When I came into your house, you gave me no water for my feet. But she washed my feet with her tears and dried my feet with her hair.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>You did not greet me with a kiss, but she has been kissing my feet since I came in.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>You did not honor me with oil for my head, but she rubbed my feet with her sweet-smelling oil.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>I tell you that her many sins are forgiven. This is clear, because she showed great love. People who are forgiven only a little will love only a little.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Then Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>The people sitting at the table began to think to themselves, “Who does this man think he is? How can he forgive sins?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Jesus said to the woman, “Because you believed, you are saved from your sins. Go in peace.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
