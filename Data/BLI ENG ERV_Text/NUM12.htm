<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 12</div><div class='s'>Miriam and Aaron Criticize Moses </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Miriam and Aaron began to talk against Moses. They criticized him because he married an Ethiopian<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Ethiopian Or “Cushite,” a person from Ethiopia, in Africa.</span></a> woman.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>They said to themselves, “Moses is not the only one the LORD has used to speak to the people. He has also spoken through us!” </div><div class='p'>The LORD heard this.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>(Moses was a very humble man. He was more humble than any other man on earth.)  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>So suddenly, the LORD came and spoke to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. He said, “You three, come to the Meeting Tent, now!” </div><div class='p'>So Moses, Aaron, and Miriam went to the Tent.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The LORD came down in the tall cloud and stood at the entrance to the Tent. He called out, “Aaron and Miriam!” They went to him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>God said, “Listen to me! You will have prophets. I, the LORD, will let them learn about me through visions. I will speak to them in dreams.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But Moses is not like that. He is my faithful servant—I trust him with everyone in my house.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>When I speak to him, I talk face to face with him. I don’t use stories with hidden meanings—I show him clearly what I want him to know. And Moses can look at the very image of the LORD. So why were you brave enough to speak against my servant Moses?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The LORD was very angry with them, and he left them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The cloud rose from the Tent. Aaron turned and looked at Miriam. Her skin was white like snow—she had a terrible skin disease! </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then Aaron said to Moses, “Please, sir, forgive us for the foolish sin that we did.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Don’t let her lose her skin like a baby who is born dead.” (Sometimes a baby will be born like that, with half of its skin eaten away.) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So Moses prayed to the LORD, “God, please heal her from this sickness!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The LORD answered Moses, “If her father spit in her face, she would be shamed for seven days. So put her outside the camp for seven days. After that she can come back into the camp.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So they took Miriam outside the camp for seven days. And the people did not move from that place until she was brought in again.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>After that the people left Hazeroth and traveled to the desert of Paran where they set up camp. </div><ul class='tnav'>
