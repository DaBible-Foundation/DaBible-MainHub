He said,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>“Son of man,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Son of man This was usually just a way of saying “a person” or “a human being.” Here, it is a way of addressing Ezekiel. Also in verse 36.</span></a> listen to this story about Samaria and Jerusalem. There were two sisters, daughters of the same mother.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>They became prostitutes in Egypt while they were still young girls. That’s where they first let men touch and handle their young breasts.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The older daughter was named Oholah,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Oholah This name means “Tent.” It probably refers to the Holy Tent where the people of Israel went to worship God.</span></a> and her sister was named Oholibah.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Oholibah This name means “My Tent is in her <span class='add'>country</span>.” Also in verses 18, 21.</span></a> They became my wives, and we had children. I am using the name Oholah to mean Samaria and the name Oholibah to mean Jerusalem. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“Then Oholah became unfaithful to me—she began to live like a prostitute. She began to want her lovers. She saw the Assyrian soldiers  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>in their blue uniforms. They were all handsome young men riding horses. They were leaders and officers,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>and Oholah gave herself to all those men. All of them were handpicked soldiers in the Assyrian army, and she wanted them all! She became filthy with their filthy idols.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Besides that, she never stopped her love affair with Egypt. Egypt made love to her when she was a young girl. Egypt was the first lover to touch her young breasts. Egypt poured his untrue love on her.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So I let her lovers have her. She wanted Assyria, so I gave her to them!  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They raped<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> raped Literally, “revealed her nakedness.” The Hebrew word meaning “revealed” is like the word meaning “carried away as a prisoner to a faraway country.”</span></a> her. They took her children and killed her. They punished her, and women still talk about her. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>“Her younger sister Oholibah saw all these things happen. But Oholibah sinned more than her sister did! She was more unfaithful than Oholah.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>She wanted the Assyrian leaders and officers. She wanted those soldiers in blue uniforms riding their horses. They were all handsome young men.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I saw that both women were going to ruin their lives with the same mistakes. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>“Oholibah continued to be unfaithful to me. In Babylon, she saw pictures of men carved on the walls. These were pictures of Chaldean men wearing their red uniforms.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>They wore belts around their waists and long turbans on their heads. All those men looked like chariot officers. They all looked like native-born Babylonian men,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and Oholibah wanted them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So the Babylonian men came to her bed to have sex with her. They used her and made her so filthy that she became disgusted with them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>“Oholibah let everyone see that she was unfaithful. She let so many men enjoy her naked body that I became disgusted with her—just as I had become disgusted with her sister.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But Oholibah thought about her time as a prostitute in Egypt when she was young, and she turned to even more prostitution.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>She remembered the lovers who excited her there, who were like animals in their sexual desires and abilities. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>“Oholibah, you dreamed of those times when you were young, when your lovers touched and handled your young breasts.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So Oholibah, this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘You became disgusted with your lovers, but I will bring them here, and they will surround you.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>I will bring all the men from Babylon, especially the Chaldeans. I will bring the men from Pekod, Shoa, and Koa, and all the men from Assyria. I will bring all the leaders and officers, all those desirable young men, chariot officers, and handpicked soldiers riding their horses.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>That crowd of men will come to you in large groups, riding on their horses and in their chariots. They will have their spears, shields, and helmets. They will gather around you, and I will tell them what you have done to me. Then they will punish you their own way.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I will show you how jealous I am. They will become angry and hurt you. They will cut off your nose and ears. They will kill you with a sword. Then they will take your children and burn whatever is left of you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>They will take your nice clothes and jewelry.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>So I will stop your dreams about your love affair with Egypt. You will never again look for them. You will never remember Egypt again!’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: “I am giving you to the men you hate. I am giving you to the men you became disgusted with.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And they will show how much they hate you! They will take everything you worked for, and they will leave you bare and naked! People will clearly see your sins. They will see that you acted like a prostitute and dreamed wicked dreams.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>You did those bad things when you left me to chase after the other nations. You did those bad things when you began to worship their filthy idols.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>You followed your sister and lived as she did. You, yourself, took her cup of poison and held it in your hands.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> You, yourself … your hands Or “I put her cup in your hands.”</span></a>”  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“You will drink your sister’s cup of poison. </div><div class='q2'>It is a tall, wide cup of poison. </div><div class='q'>It holds much poison. </div><div class='q2'>People will laugh at you and make fun of you. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>You will stagger like a drunk. </div><div class='q2'>You will become very dizzy. </div><div class='q'>That is the cup of destruction and devastation. </div><div class='q2'>It is like the cup of punishment that your sister drank. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>You will drink the poison in that cup. </div><div class='q2'>You will drink it to the last drop. </div><div class='q'>You will throw down the glass and break it to pieces. </div><div class='q2'>You will tear at your breasts from the pain. </div><div class='q'>This will happen because I am the Lord GOD, </div><div class='q2'>and this is what I said. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>“So this is what the Lord GOD said: ‘Jerusalem, you forgot me.

You must suffer for your wicked dreams.’ ” </div><div class='s'>Judgment Against Oholah and Oholibah </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>The LORD said to me, “Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah?

They acted like prostitutes—they left me to be with their filthy idols. They had my children, but they forced them to pass through fire. They did this to give food to their filthy idols.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>They also treated my special days of rest and my holy place as though they were not important.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>They killed their children for their idols, and then they went into my holy place and made it filthy too! They did this inside my Temple! </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>“They have sent for men from faraway places.

They gave bracelets and beautiful crowns to the women.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Then I spoke to one of the women who was worn out from her sexual sins. I asked her, ‘Will they continue to do sexual sins with her, and she with them?’  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>But they kept going to her as they would go to a prostitute.
