You will be the only people in the whole land.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I heard the LORD All-Powerful make this oath: “I swear, all these houses will be destroyed. These big, fancy houses will be empty.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>A ten-acre vineyard will make only a little wine,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> only a little wine Literally, “one bath,” a measure that equals about 6 gallons (22 l).</span></a> and many sacks of seed will grow only a little grain.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> only a little grain Literally, “A homer of seed will grow only an ephah of grain.” A homer equals about 6 bushels (220 l).

You stay awake late at night, getting drunk on wine.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>At your parties with your wine, harps, drums, flutes, and other musical instruments, you don’t see what the LORD has done. You don’t notice what his hands have made. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>My people don’t really know God. So they will be captured and taken away. Everyone, the respected leaders and the common people as well, will be hungry and thirsty.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>They will die, and the place of death will open its mouth wide and swallow many of them. Then the noisy crowds and all the beautiful, happy people who are now so comfortable will go down into the grave. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Everyone, common people and leaders alike, will be humbled. Those who are now so proud will bow their heads in shame.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The LORD All-Powerful will judge fairly, and people will honor him. They will respect the Holy God when he brings justice.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then sheep will be able to go wherever they want and graze on the land that rich people once owned. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Look at those people! They pull their guilt and sins behind them like people pulling wagons with ropes.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> ropes Literally, “useless ropes.” The Hebrew words here are like those meaning “useless things,” that is, idols.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They say, “We wish God would hurry and do what he plans to do so that we can see it. Let the plan of the Holy One of Israel happen soon so that we can know what it is.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Look at those people! They say good is bad and bad is good. They think light is dark and dark is light. They think sour is sweet and sweet is sour.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>They think they are so smart. They think they are very intelligent.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>They are famous for drinking wine and are heroes known for mixing drinks.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And if you pay them enough money, they will forgive a criminal. But they will not let good people be judged fairly.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So bad things will happen to them. Their descendants will be destroyed completely, just as fire burns straw and leaves. Their descendants will be like plants with rotten roots, whose flowers have all blown away like dust in the wind. </div><div class='p'>Those people refused to obey the teachings<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> teachings This can also mean “laws.” Sometimes this means the laws God gave Moses to teach to the people of Israel.</span></a> of the LORD All-Powerful. They hated the message from the Holy One of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So the LORD became angry with his people, and he raised his hand to punish them. Even the mountains shook with fear. Dead bodies were left in the streets like garbage. And he is not finished yet. He is still angry, and his arm is raised to continue punishing his people. </div><div class='s'>God Will Bring Armies to Punish Israel </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Look! God is giving a sign to the nations far away. He is raising a flag and whistling for them to come. </div><div class='p'>Now the enemy is coming from a faraway land and will soon enter the country. They are moving very quickly.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The enemy soldiers never get tired and stumble. They never get sleepy and fall asleep. Their weapon belts are always ready. Their sandal straps never break.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Their arrows are sharp. Their bows are strung and ready to shoot. The horses’ hooves are as hard as flint. Clouds of dust rise from behind their chariots. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The shouts of the enemy sound like the roar of lions. Like strong, young lions, they growl and grab their prey. The captives struggle and try to escape, but there is no one to save them.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then there is a roar as loud as the ocean waves, and the captives turn their faces to the ground. And there is only darkness closing in as the light fades away in a black cloud. </div><ul class='tnav'>
