<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 20</div><div class='s'>News That Jesus Has Risen From Death </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 28:1–10; Mk. 16:1–8; Lk. 24:1–12) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Early on Sunday morning, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb. She saw that the large stone was moved away from the entrance.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>So she ran to Simon Peter and the other follower (the one Jesus loved very much). She said, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don’t know where they put him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So Peter and the other follower started going to the tomb.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They were both running, but the other follower ran faster than Peter and reached the tomb first.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>He bent down and looked in. He saw the pieces of linen cloth lying there, but he did not go in. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then Simon Peter finally reached the tomb and went in. He saw the pieces of linen lying there.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He also saw the cloth that had been around Jesus’ head. It was folded up and laid in a different place from the pieces of linen.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then the other follower went in—the one who had reached the tomb first. He saw what had happened and believed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>(These followers did not yet understand from the Scriptures that Jesus must rise from death.) </div><div class='s'>Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 16:9–11) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then the followers went back home.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But Mary stood outside the tomb, crying. While she was crying, she bent down and looked inside the tomb.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>She saw two angels dressed in white sitting where Jesus’ body had been. One was sitting where the head had been; the other was sitting where the feet had been. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The angels asked Mary, “Woman, why are you crying?” </div><div class='p'>Mary answered, “They took away the body of my Lord, and I don’t know where they put him.”  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>When Mary said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there. But she did not know that it was Jesus. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He asked her, “Woman, why are you crying? Who are you looking for?” </div><div class='p'>She thought he was the man in charge of the garden. So she said to him, “Did you take him away, sir? Tell me where you put him. I will go and get him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Jesus said to her, “Mary.” </div><div class='p'>She turned toward him and said in Aramaic, <span class='tl'>“Rabboni,”</span> which means “Teacher.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Jesus said to her, “You don’t need to hold on to me! I have not yet gone back up to the Father. But go to my followers<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> followers Literally, “brothers.”</span></a> and tell them this: ‘I am going back to my Father and your Father. I am going back to my God and your God.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Mary Magdalene went to the followers and told them, “I saw the Lord!” And she told them what he had said to her. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Appears to His Followers </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 28:16–20; Mk. 16:14–18; Lk. 24:36–49) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The day was Sunday, and that same evening the followers were together. They had the doors locked because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. Suddenly, Jesus was standing there among them. He said, “Peace be with you!”  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>As soon as he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. When the followers saw the Lord, they were very happy. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then Jesus said again, “Peace be with you. It was the Father who sent me, and I am now sending you in the same way.”  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then he breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>If you forgive the sins of anyone, their sins are forgiven. If there is anyone whose sins you don’t forgive, their sins are not forgiven.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Appears to Thomas </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Thomas (called Didymus) was one of the twelve, but he was not with the other followers when Jesus came.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>They told him, “We saw the Lord.” Thomas said, “That’s hard to believe. I will have to see the nail holes in his hands, put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side. Only then will I believe it.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>A week later the followers were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. The doors were locked, but Jesus came and stood among them. He said, “Peace be with you!”  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here. Look at my hands. Put your hand here in my side. Stop doubting and believe.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Thomas said to Jesus, “My Lord and my God!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Jesus said to him, “You believe because you see me. Great blessings belong to the people who believe without seeing me!” </div><div class='s'>Why John Wrote This Book </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Jesus did many other miraculous signs that his followers saw, which are not written in this book.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But these are written so that you can believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God. Then, by believing, you can have life through his name. </div><ul class='tnav'>
