<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='s'>The Right Way to Live </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Remind your people that they should always be under the authority of rulers and government leaders. They should obey these leaders and be ready to do good.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Tell them not to speak evil of anyone but to live in peace with others. They should be gentle and polite to everyone. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>In the past we were foolish too. We did not obey, we were wrong, and we were slaves to the many things our bodies wanted and enjoyed. We lived doing evil and being jealous. People hated us and we hated each other.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But then the kindness and love of God our Savior was made known.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>He saved us because of his mercy, not because of any good things we did. He saved us through the washing that made us new people. He saved us by making us new through the Holy Spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>God poured out to us that Holy Spirit fully through Jesus Christ our Savior.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>We were made right with God by his grace. God saved us so that we could be his children and look forward to receiving life that never ends.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>This is a true statement. </div><div class='p'>And I want you to be sure that the people understand these things. Then those who believe in God will be careful to use their lives for doing good. These things are good and will help everyone. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Stay away from those who have foolish arguments, who talk about useless family histories, or who make trouble and fight about what the Law of Moses teaches. These things are useless and will not help anyone.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Give a warning to all those who cause arguments. If they continue to cause trouble after a second warning, then don’t associate with them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>You know that people like that are evil and sinful. Their sins prove they are wrong. </div><div class='s'>Final Instructions and Greetings </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I will send Artemas and Tychicus to you. When I send them, try hard to come to me at Nicopolis. I have decided to stay there this winter.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Zenas the lawyer and Apollos will be traveling from there. Do all that you can to help them prepare for their trip. Be sure that they have everything they need.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Our people must learn to use their lives for doing good and helping anyone who has a need. Then they will not have empty lives. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>All the people with me here send you their greetings. Give my greetings to those who love us in the faith. </div><div class='p'>Grace be with you all. </div><ul class='tnav'>
