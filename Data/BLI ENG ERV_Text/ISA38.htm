The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to see him and told him, “The LORD told me to tell you this: ‘You will die soon. So you should tell your family what they should do when you die. You will not get well.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Hezekiah turned toward the wall that faced the Temple and began praying to the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>“LORD, remember that I have faithfully served you with all my heart. I have done what you say is good.” Then Hezekiah cried very hard. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then Isaiah received this message from the LORD:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“Go to Hezekiah and tell him that the LORD, the God of your ancestor David, says, ‘I heard your prayer, and I saw your tears. I will add 15 years to your life.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I will save you and this city from the king of Assyria.
