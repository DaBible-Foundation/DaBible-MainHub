<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 27</div><div class='s'>Zelophehad’s Daughters </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Zelophehad was the son of Hepher. Hepher was the son of Gilead. Gilead was the son of Makir. Makir was the son of Manasseh. Manasseh was the son of Joseph. Zelophehad had five daughters. Their names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>These five women went to the Meeting Tent and stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders, and all the Israelites. </div><div class='p'>The five daughters said,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>“Our father died while we were traveling through the desert. He died a natural death. He was not one of the men who joined Korah’s group. (Korah was the man who turned against the LORD.) But our father had no sons.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>This means that our father’s name will not continue. It is not fair that our father’s name will not continue. His name will end because he had no sons. So we ask you to give us some of the land that our father’s brothers will get.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So Moses asked the LORD what he should do.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The LORD said to him,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>“The daughters of Zelophehad are right. They should share the land with their father’s brothers. So give them the land that you would have given to their father. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“So tell the Israelites, ‘If a man has no son, when he dies everything he owns will be given to his daughter.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>If he has no daughter, everything he owns will be given to his brothers.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>If he has no brothers, everything he owns will be given to his father’s brothers.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>If his father had no brothers, everything he owns will be given to the closest relative in his family. This will be a law among the Israelites. The LORD has given this command to Moses.’ ” </div><div class='s'>Joshua Is the New Leader </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go up on one of mountains in the desert east of the Jordan River. There you will see the land that I am giving to the Israelites.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>After you have seen this land, you will die like your brother Aaron.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Remember when the people became angry at the water in the desert of Zin. Both you and Aaron refused to obey my command. You did not honor me and show the people that I am holy.” (This was at the water of Meribah<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> water of Meribah Or “water of rebellion.”</span></a> near Kadesh in the desert of Zin.) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Moses said to the LORD,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>“LORD, you are the God who knows what people are thinking. I pray that you will choose a leader for these people.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> LORD, … these people Literally, “May the LORD, the God of the spirits of all people, appoint a man for this community.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I pray that you will choose a leader who will lead them out of this land and bring them into the new land. Then your people will not be like sheep without a shepherd.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>So the LORD said to Moses, “Joshua son of Nun is very wise.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Joshua … is very wise Literally, “Take Joshua son of Nun. He is a man with a spirit in him.” This might mean that Joshua was very wise, or it might mean that God’s Spirit was with him.</span></a> You will place your hand on him and make him the new leader.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Tell him to stand before Eleazar the priest and all the people. Then make him the new leader. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>“Show the people that you are making him leader,<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Show … leader Literally, “Give him some of your glory.”</span></a> then all the people will obey him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>If Joshua needs to make a decision, he will go to Eleazar the priest. Eleazar will use the Urim to learn the LORD’S answer. Then Joshua and all the Israelites will do the things God says. If he says, ‘go to war,’ they will go to war. And if he says, ‘go home,’ they will go home.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Moses obeyed the LORD. Moses told Joshua to stand before Eleazar the priest and all the Israelites.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then Moses put his hands on him to show that he was the new leader. He did this just as the LORD told him to. </div><ul class='tnav'>
