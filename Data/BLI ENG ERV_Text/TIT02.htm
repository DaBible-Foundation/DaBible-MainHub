<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 2</div><div class='s'>Following the True Teaching </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>You, however, must tell everyone how to live in a way that agrees with the true teaching.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Teach the older men to have self-control, to be serious, and to be wise. They must be strong in faith, in love, and in patience. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Also, teach the older women to live the way those who serve the Lord should live. They should not go around saying bad things about others or be in the habit of drinking too much. They should teach what is good.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>By doing this they will teach the younger women to love their husbands and children.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They will teach them to be wise and pure, to take care of their homes, to be kind, and to be willing to serve their husbands. Then no one will be able to criticize the teaching God gave us. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>In the same way, tell the young men to be wise.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>You should be an example for them in every way by the good things you do. When you teach, be honest and serious.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And your teaching should be clearly right so that you cannot be criticized. Then anyone who is against you will be ashamed. There will not be anything bad they can say about us. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And tell this to those who are slaves: They should be willing to serve their masters at all times; they should try to please them, not argue with them;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>they should not steal from them; and they should show their masters that they can be trusted. Then, in everything they do, they will show that the teaching of God our Savior is good. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>That is the way we should live, because God’s grace has come. That grace can save everyone.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>It teaches us not to live against God and not to do the bad things the world wants to do. It teaches us to live on earth now in a wise and right way—a way that shows true devotion to God.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>We should live like that while we are waiting for the coming of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ. He is our great hope, and he will come with glory.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He gave himself for us. He died to free us from all evil. He died to make us pure—people who belong only to him and who always want to do good. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>These are the things you should tell people. Encourage them, and when they are wrong, correct them. You have full authority to do this, so don’t let anyone think they can ignore you. </div><ul class='tnav'>
