Nebo<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Nebo A false god of Babylon.</span></a> is kneeling before me. </div><div class='p'>“Men put those idols on the backs of animals. They are only heavy burdens that must be carried. They do nothing but make people tired.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>But they all bowed down and fell to the ground. They couldn’t escape; they were all carried away like prisoners. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>“Family of Jacob, listen to me! You who are left from the family of Israel, listen! I have carried you since you left your mother’s womb. I carried you when you were born,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>and I will still be carrying you when you are old. Your hair will turn gray, and I will still carry you. I made you, and I will carry you to safety. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“Can you compare me to anyone? No one is equal to me. You cannot understand everything about me. There is nothing like me.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Some people are rich with gold and silver. Gold falls from their purses, and they weigh their silver on scales. They pay an artist to make a false god from wood. Then they bow down and worship that false god.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>They put their false god on their shoulders and carry it. That false god is useless; people have to carry it! People set the statue on the ground, and it cannot move. That false god never walks away from its place. People can yell at it, but it will not answer. That false god is only a statue; it cannot save people from their troubles. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“Sinners, change your heart and mind. Think about this again. Remember it and be strong.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Remember what happened long ago. Remember, I am God and there is no other God. There is no other like me. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>“In the beginning, I told you what would happen in the end. A long time ago, I told you things that have not happened yet. When I plan something, it happens. I do whatever I want to do.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I am calling a man from the east to do what I want. He will come like an eagle from a faraway country. He will do all that I have planned. Everything I said will happen just as I said it would. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>“Listen to me, you stubborn<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> stubborn Literally, “mighty of heart.”</span></a> people! You are far from doing what is right.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But I am close to making things right. Salvation will not be delayed much longer. I will bring salvation to Zion and to my wonderful Israel.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
