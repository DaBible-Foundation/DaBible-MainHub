The leading priests and teachers of the law were trying to find a way to arrest Jesus without the people seeing it. Then they could kill him.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>They said, “But we cannot arrest Jesus during the festival. We don’t want the people to be angry and cause a riot.” </div><div class='s'>A Woman Does Something Special </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 26:6–13; Jn. 12:1–8) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper. While he was eating there, a woman came to him. She had an alabaster jar filled with expensive perfume made of pure nard. She opened the jar and poured the perfume on Jesus’ head. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Some of the followers there saw this. They were upset and complained to each other. They said, “Why waste that perfume?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>It was worth a full year’s pay.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> a full year’s pay Literally, “300 denarii.” One Roman denarius, a silver coin, was the average pay for one day’s work.</span></a> It could have been sold and the money given to those who are poor.” And they told the woman what a bad thing she had done. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Jesus said, “Leave her alone. Why are you giving her such trouble? She did a very good thing for me.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>You will always have the poor with you,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> You will … with you See Deut. 15:11.</span></a> and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>This woman did the only thing she could do for me. She poured perfume on my body before I die to prepare it for burial.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The Good News will be told to people all over the world. And I can assure you that everywhere the Good News is told, the story of what this woman did will also be told, and people will remember her.” </div><div class='s'>Judas Agrees to Help Jesus’ Enemies </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 26:14–16; Lk. 22:3–6) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve apostles, went to talk to the leading priests about handing Jesus over to them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>They were very happy about this, and they promised to pay him. So he waited for the best time to hand Jesus over to them. </div><div class='s'>The Passover Meal </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 26:17–25; Lk. 22:7–14, 21–23; Jn. 13:21–30) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>It was now the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread—the day the lambs were killed for the Passover. Jesus’ followers came to him and said, “We will go and prepare everything for you to eat the Passover meal. Where do you want us to have the meal?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Jesus sent two of his followers into the city. He said to them, “Go into the city. You will see a man carrying a jar of water. He will come to you. Follow him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He will go into a house. Tell the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher asks that you show us the room where he and his followers can eat the Passover meal.’  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The owner will show you a large room upstairs that is ready for us. Prepare the meal for us there.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So the followers left and went into the city. Everything happened the way Jesus said. So the followers prepared the Passover meal. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>In the evening Jesus went to that house with the twelve apostles.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>While they were all at the table eating, he said, “Believe me when I say that one of you will hand me over to my enemies—one of you eating with me now.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The followers were very sad to hear this. Each one said to Jesus, “Surely I am not the one!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “It is one of you twelve—the one who is dipping his bread in the same bowl with me.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The Son of Man will suffer what the Scriptures say will happen to him. But it will be very bad for the one who hands over the Son of Man to be killed. It would be better for him if he had never been born.” </div><div class='s'>The Lord’s Supper </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 26:26–30; Lk. 22:15–20; 1 Cor. 11:23–25) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>While they were eating, Jesus took some bread and thanked God for it. He broke off some pieces, gave them to his followers and said, “Take and eat this bread. It is my body.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then he took a cup of wine, thanked God for it, and gave it to them. They all drank from the cup.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then he said, “This wine is my blood, which will be poured out for many to begin the new agreement from God to his people.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I want you to know, I will not drink this wine again until that day when I drink it in God’s kingdom and the wine is new.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>They all sang a song and then went out to the Mount of Olives. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Says His Followers Will Leave Him </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 26:31–35; Lk. 22:31–34; Jn. 13:36–38) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then Jesus told the followers, “You will all lose your faith. The Scriptures say, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>‘I will kill the shepherd, </div><div class='q2'>and the sheep will run away.’ <span class='rq'>Zechariah 13:7</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But after I am killed, I will rise from death. Then I will go to Galilee. I will be there before you come.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Peter said, “All the other followers may lose their faith. But my faith will never be shaken.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “The truth is, tonight you will say you don’t know me. You will say it three times before the rooster crows twice.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But Peter strongly protested, “I will never say I don’t know you! I will even die with you!” And all the other followers said the same thing. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Prays Alone </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 26:36–46; Lk. 22:39–46) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Jesus and his followers went to a place named Gethsemane. He said to them, “Sit here while I pray.”  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But he told Peter, James, and John to come with him. He began to be very distressed and troubled,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>and he said to them, “My heart is so heavy with grief, I feel as if I am dying. Wait here and stay awake.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Jesus went on a little farther away from them, fell to the ground, and prayed. He asked that, if possible, he would not have this time of suffering.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>He said, “<span class='tl'>Abba</span>,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Abba An Aramaic word that was used by Jewish children as a name for their fathers.</span></a> Father! You can do all things. Don’t make me drink from this cup.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> cup A symbol of suffering. Jesus used the idea of drinking from a cup to mean accepting the suffering he would face in the terrible events that were soon to come.</span></a> But do what you want, not what I want.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Then he went back to his followers and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, “Simon, why are you sleeping? Could you not stay awake with me for one hour?  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Stay awake and pray for strength against temptation. Your spirit wants to do what is right, but your body is weak.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Again Jesus went away and prayed the same thing.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Then he went back to the followers and again found them sleeping. They could not stay awake. They did not know what they should say to him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>After Jesus prayed a third time, he went back to his followers. He said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? That’s enough! The time has come for the Son of Man to be handed over to the control of sinful men.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Stand up! We must go. Here comes the man who is handing me over to them.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Is Arrested </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 26:47–56; Lk. 22:47–53; Jn. 18:3–12) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve apostles, came there. He had a big crowd of people with him, all carrying swords and clubs. They had been sent from the leading priests, the teachers of the law, and the older Jewish leaders. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Judas<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Judas Literally, “the one who handed him over.”</span></a> planned to do something to show them which one was Jesus. He said, “The one I kiss will be Jesus. Arrest him and guard him while you lead him away.”  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>So Judas went over to Jesus and said, “Teacher!” Then he kissed him.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>The men grabbed Jesus and arrested him.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>One of the followers standing near Jesus grabbed his sword and pulled it out. He swung it at the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Then Jesus said, “Why do you come to get me with swords and clubs as if I were a criminal?  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Every day I was with you teaching in the Temple area. You did not arrest me there. But all these things have happened to show the full meaning of what the Scriptures said.”  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Then all of Jesus’ followers left him and ran away. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>One of those following Jesus was a young man wearing only a linen cloth. When the people tried to grab him,  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>he left the cloth in their hands and ran away naked. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Before the Jewish Leaders </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 26:57–68; Lk. 22:54–55, 63–71; Jn. 18:13–14, 19–24) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>Those who arrested Jesus led him to the house of the high priest. All the leading priests, the older Jewish leaders, and the teachers of the law were gathered there.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>Peter followed Jesus but stayed back at a distance. He followed him to the yard of the high priest’s house. He went into the yard and sat there with the guards, warming himself by their fire. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>The leading priests and the whole high council tried to find something that Jesus had done wrong so they could kill him. But the council could find no proof that would allow them to kill Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Many people came and told lies against Jesus, but they all said different things. None of them agreed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>Then some others stood up and told more lies against Jesus. They said,  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>“We heard this man<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> this man That is, Jesus. His enemies avoided saying his name.</span></a> say, ‘I will destroy this Temple built by human hands. And three days later, I will build another Temple not made by human hands.’ ”  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>But also what these people said did not agree. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>Then the high priest stood up before everyone and said to Jesus, “These people said things against you. Do you have something to say about their charges? Are they telling the truth?”  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>But Jesus said nothing to answer him. </div><div class='p'>The high priest asked Jesus another question: “Are you the Messiah, the Son of the blessed God?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “Yes, I am the Son of God. And in the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right side of God All-Powerful. And you will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>When the high priest heard this, he tore his clothes in anger. He said, “We don’t need any more witnesses!  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>You all heard these insults to God. What do you think?” </div><div class='p'>Everyone agreed that Jesus was guilty and must be killed.  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>Some of the people there spit at him. They covered his eyes and hit him with their fists. They said, “Be a prophet<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> prophet A prophet often knows things that are hidden to other people.</span></a> and tell us who hit you!” Then the guards led Jesus away and beat him. </div><div class='s'>Peter Is Afraid to Say He Knows Jesus </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 26:69–75; Lk. 22:56–62; Jn. 18:15–18, 25–27) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>While Peter was still in the yard, a servant girl of the high priest came there.  <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>She saw him warming himself by the fire. She looked closely at him and said, “You were with Jesus, that man from Nazareth.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>But Peter said this was not true. “That makes no sense,” he said. “I don’t know what you are talking about!” Then he left and went to the entrance of the yard, and a rooster crowed.<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Some Greek copies do not have “and a rooster crowed.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>When the servant girl saw him there, she began saying again to the people standing around, “This man is one of them.”  <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span>Again Peter said it was not true. </div><div class='p'>A short time later, the people standing there said, “We know you are one of them, because you are from Galilee.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V71">71&#160;</span>Then Peter began to curse. He said, “I swear to God, I don’t know this man you are talking about!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V72">72&#160;</span>As soon as Peter said this, the rooster crowed the second time. Then he remembered what Jesus had told him: “Before the rooster crows twice, you will say three times that you don’t know me.” Then Peter began to cry. </div><ul class='tnav'>
