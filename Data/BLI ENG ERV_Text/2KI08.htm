<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 8</div><div class='s'>The King and the Shunammite Woman </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Elisha talked to the woman whose son he had brought back to life. He said, “You and your family should move to another country, because the LORD has decided that there will be a famine here. It will last for seven years.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>So the woman did what the man of God said. She went with her family to stay in the land of the Philistines for seven years.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>After seven years she returned from the land of the Philistines. </div><div class='p'>She went to speak with the king to ask him to help her get back her house and land. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The king was talking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God. The king said to Gehazi, “Please tell me all the great things Elisha has done.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Gehazi was telling the king about Elisha bringing a dead person back to life. At that same time the woman whose son Elisha brought back to life went to the king. She wanted to ask him to help her get back her house and land. Gehazi said, “My lord and king, this is the woman, and this is the son who Elisha brought back to life.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The king asked the woman what she wanted, and she told him. </div><div class='p'>Then the king chose an officer to help her. The king said, “Give to the woman all that belongs to her. And give her all the harvest of her land from the day she left the country until now.” </div><div class='s'>Ben-Hadad Sends Hazael to Elisha </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Elisha went to Damascus. King Ben-Hadad of Aram was sick. Someone told Ben-Hadad, “The man of God has come here.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then the King Ben-Hadad said to Hazael, “Take a gift and go meet the man of God. Ask him to ask the LORD if I will get well from my sickness.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So Hazael went to meet Elisha. Hazael brought a gift with him. He brought all kinds of good things from Damascus. It took 40 camels to carry everything. Hazael came to Elisha and said, “Your follower,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> follower Literally, “son.”</span></a> King Ben-Hadad of Aram, sent me to you. He asks if he will get well from his sickness.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Elisha said to Hazael, “Go and tell Ben-Hadad, ‘You will live.’ But really the LORD told me, ‘He will die.’ ” </div><div class='s'>Elisha Makes a Prophecy About Hazael </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Elisha began to stare. He stared for an embarrassingly long time. Then the man of God began to cry.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Hazael said, “Sir, why are you crying?” </div><div class='p'>Elisha answered, “I am crying because I know the bad things you will do to the Israelites. You will burn their strong cities and kill their young men with swords. You will kill their babies and split open their pregnant women.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Hazael said, “I am not a powerful man!<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> I … powerful man Literally, “Your servant is only a dog!”</span></a> How can I do these great things?” </div><div class='p'>Elisha answered, “The LORD showed me that you will be king over Aram.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then Hazael left Elisha and went to his king.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> king Literally, “master.”</span></a> Ben-Hadad said to Hazael, “What did Elisha say to you?” </div><div class='p'>He answered, “Elisha told me that you will live.” </div><div class='s'>Hazael Murders Ben-Hadad </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But the next day Hazael took a thick cloth and dipped it in water. Then he held it on Ben-Hadad’s face until he died. Then Hazael became the new king. </div><div class='s'>Jehoram Begins His Rule </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat was the king of Judah. He began to rule in the fifth year that Joram son of Ahab was king of Israel.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> The standard Hebrew text adds “while Jehoshaphat was still king of Judah.” That is, according to the Hebrew, father and son ruled Judah together for a time.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Jehoram was 32 years old when he began to rule. He ruled eight years in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But Jehoram lived as the kings of Israel and did what the LORD saw as evil. He lived as the people from Ahab’s family, because his wife was Ahab’s daughter.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But the LORD would not destroy Judah because of the promise to his servant David. He had promised David that someone from his family would always be king. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>In Jehoram’s time Edom broke away from Judah’s rule. The people of Edom chose a king for themselves. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then Jehoram and all his chariots went to Zair. The Edomite army surrounded them, but Jehoram and his officers attacked them and escaped. Jehoram’s soldiers all ran away and went home.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So the Edomites broke away from the rule of Judah. And they have been free from the rule of Judah until today. </div><div class='p'>At the same time Libnah also broke away from Judah’s rule. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>All the things Jehoram did are written in the book, <span class='bk'>The History of the Kings of Judah</span>. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Jehoram died and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. Jehoram’s son Ahaziah became the new king. </div><div class='s'>Ahaziah Begins His Rule </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Ahaziah son of Jehoram became the king of Judah in the 12th year that Joram son of Ahab was king of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Ahaziah was 22 years old when he began to rule. He ruled one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah. She was the daughter of King Omri of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Ahaziah did what the LORD said was wrong. He did many bad things, just as the people from Ahab’s family had done. He lived like this because his wife was from Ahab’s family. </div><div class='s'>Joram Is Hurt in the War Against Hazael </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Joram was from Ahab’s family. Ahaziah went with Joram to fight against King Hazael of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>King Joram went back to Israel so that he could get well from those wounds. He went to the area of Jezreel. Ahaziah son of Jehoram was the king of Judah. Ahaziah went to Jezreel to see Joram. </div><ul class='tnav'>
