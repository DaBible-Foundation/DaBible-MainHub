He said,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>“Son of man,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Son of man This was usually just a way of saying “a person” or “a human being.” Here, it is a way of addressing Ezekiel.

They have ears to hear what I told them to do, but they don’t hear my commands, because they are a rebellious people.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So, son of man, pack some things as if you are leaving on a trip. Pretend that you are a prisoner being taken far away. Do this during the day so that everyone can see you. Even though these people refuse to listen to me, maybe when they see you going away, they will understand what I have been trying to tell them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>“During the day, take your bags outside so that the people can see you. Then in the evening, pretend you are going away. Act as if you are a prisoner going to a faraway country.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>While the people are watching, make a hole in the wall and go out through that hole in the wall.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>At night, put your bag on your shoulder and leave. Cover your face so that you cannot see where you are going. You must do these things so that the people can see you, because I am using you as an example to the family of Israel.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So I did as I was commanded. During the day, I took my bags and acted as if I were going to a faraway country. That evening, I used my hands and made a hole in the wall. During the night, I put my bag on my shoulder and left. I did this so that all the people could see me. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The next morning, the word of the LORD came to me. He said,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“Son of man, did the people of Israel—those people who always refuse to obey—ask you what you were doing?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Tell them that this is what the Lord GOD said. This sad message is about the leader of Jerusalem and all the people of Israel who live there.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Tell them, ‘I am an example for all of you. What I have done will happen to you.’ You will be forced to go to a faraway country as prisoners.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And your leader will make a hole in the wall and sneak out at night. He will cover his face so that people will not recognize him. His eyes will not be able to see where he is going.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He will try to escape, but I will catch him! He will be caught in my trap. Then I will bring him to Babylonia—the land of the Chaldeans.

Then they will know that I am the LORD.” </div><div class='s'>Shake With Fear </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then the word of the LORD came to me. He said,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>“Son of man, you must act as if you are very frightened. You must shake when you eat your food. You must act worried and afraid when you drink your water.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>You must say this to the common people: ‘This is what the Lord GOD says to the people living in Jerusalem and in the other parts of Israel. You will be very worried while you eat your food. You will be terrified while you drink your water, because everything in your country will be destroyed! This will happen because the people living there are so violent.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Many people live in your cities now, but those cities will be ruined. Your whole country will be destroyed!

I will not wait any longer. Those troubles are coming soon—in your own lifetime. Hear me, you people who always refuse to obey! When I say something, I make it happen.” This is what the Lord GOD said. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then the word of the LORD came to me. He said,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>“Son of man, the people of Israel think that the visions I give you are for a time far in the future. They think you are talking about things that will happen many years from now.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So you must tell them this: ‘The Lord GOD says, I will not delay any longer. If I say something will happen, it will happen!’ ” This is what the Lord GOD said. </div><ul class='tnav'>
