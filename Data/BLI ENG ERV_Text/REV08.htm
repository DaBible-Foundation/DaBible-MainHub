Then there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And I saw the seven angels who stand before God. They were given seven trumpets. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Another angel came and stood at the altar. This angel had a golden holder for incense. The angel was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all God’s holy people. The angel put this offering on the golden altar before the throne.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The smoke from the incense went up from the angel’s hand to God. The smoke went up with the prayers of God’s people.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then the angel filled the incense holder with fire from the altar and threw it down on the earth. Then there were flashes of lightning, thunder and other noises, and an earthquake. </div><div class='s'>The First of Seven Trumpet Blasts </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then the seven angels with the seven trumpets prepared to blow their trumpets. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The first angel blew his trumpet.
