God’s voice was loud like the sound of the sea. The ground was bright with the light from the Glory of God.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The vision that I saw was like the vision I saw by the Kebar Canal. I bowed with my face to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The Glory of the LORD came into the Temple through the east gate. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then the Spirit<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Spirit Or “spirit” or “wind.”</span></a> picked me up and brought me into the inner courtyard. The Glory of the LORD filled the Temple.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I heard someone speaking to me from inside the Temple. The man was still standing beside me.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The voice from the Temple said to me, “Son of man,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Son of man This was usually just a way of saying “a person” or “a human being.” Here, it is a way of addressing Ezekiel.

In the past, only a wall separated them from me. So they brought shame to my name every time they sinned and did those terrible things. That is why I became angry and destroyed them.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Now let them take their sexual sins and the dead bodies of their kings far away from me. Then I will live among them forever. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>“Now, son of man, tell the family of Israel about the Temple. Then, when they learn about the plans for the Temple, they will be ashamed of their sins.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they will be ashamed of all the bad things they have done. Let them know the design of the Temple. Let them know how it should be built, where the entrances and exits are, and all the designs on it. Teach them about all its rules and all its laws. Write these things for everyone to see so that they can obey all the laws and rules for the Temple.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>This is the law of the Temple: The whole area surrounding it on the top of the mountain is most holy.

These men are the priests from the tribe of Levi. They are the men who serve me by bringing the offerings to me.’ ” This is what the Lord GOD said.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>“You will take some of the bull’s blood and put it on the altar’s four horns, on the four corners of the ledge, and on the rim around it.

The priests will sprinkle salt on them. Then they will offer the bull and ram up as a burnt offering to the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>You will prepare a goat every day for seven days for a sin offering. Also, you will prepare a young bull and a ram from the flock.
