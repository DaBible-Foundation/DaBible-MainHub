<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 21</div><div class='s'>The New Jerusalem </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth. The first heaven and the first earth had disappeared. Now there was no sea.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> new Jerusalem The spiritual city where God’s people live with him.</span></a> coming down out of heaven from God. It was prepared like a bride dressed for her husband. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I heard a loud voice from the throne. It said, “Now God’s home is with people. He will live with them. They will be his people. God himself will be with them and will be their God.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death, sadness, crying, or pain. All the old ways are gone.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The one who was sitting on the throne said, “Look, I am making everything new!” Then he said, “Write this, because these words are true and can be trusted.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The one on the throne said to me, “It is finished! I am the Alpha and the Omega,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Alpha … Omega The first and last letters in the Greek alphabet, meaning the beginning and the end.</span></a> the Beginning and the End. I will give free water from the spring of the water of life to anyone who is thirsty.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>All those who win the victory will receive all this. And I will be their God, and they will be my children.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But those who are cowards, those who refuse to believe, those who do terrible things, those who kill, those who sin sexually, those who do evil magic, those who worship idols, and those who tell lies—they will all have a place in the lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>One of the seven angels came to me. This was one of the angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues. The angel said, “Come with me. I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.”  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The angel carried me away by the Spirit to a very large and high mountain. The angel showed me the holy city, Jerusalem. The city was coming down out of heaven from God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The city was shining with the glory of God. It was shining bright like a very expensive jewel, like a jasper. It was clear as crystal.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The city had a large, high wall with twelve gates. There were twelve angels at the gates. On each gate was written the name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The walls of the city were built on twelve foundation stones. On the stones were written the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod made of gold. The angel had this rod to measure the city, its gates, and its wall.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The city was built in a square. Its length was equal to its width. The angel measured the city with the rod. The city was 12,000 <span class='tl'>stadia</span><a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> stadia One Greek <span class='tl'>stadion </span>was 600 feet, about 185 meters.</span></a> long, 12,000 <span class='tl'>stadia</span> wide, and 12,000 <span class='tl'>stadia</span> high.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The angel also measured the wall. It was 144 cubits<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> cubits A cubit is the length of a man’s arm from the elbow to the tip of the little finger, about half a meter.</span></a> high. (The angel was using the same measurement that people use.)  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The wall was made of jasper. The city was made of pure gold, as pure as glass. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The foundation stones of the city walls had every kind of expensive jewels in them. The first foundation stone was jasper, the second was sapphire, the third was chalcedony, the fourth was emerald,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>the fifth was onyx, the sixth was carnelian, the seventh was yellow quartz, the eighth was beryl, the ninth was topaz, the tenth was chrysoprase, the eleventh was jacinth, and the twelfth was amethyst.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The twelve gates were twelve pearls. Each gate was made from one pearl. The street of the city was made of pure gold, as clear as glass. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>I did not see a temple in the city. The Lord God All-Powerful and the Lamb were the city’s temple.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The city did not need the sun or the moon to shine on it. The glory of God gave the city light. The Lamb was the city’s lamp. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The peoples of the world will walk by the light given by the Lamb. The rulers of the earth will bring their glory into the city.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The city’s gates will never close on any day, because there is no night there.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The greatness and the honor of the nations will be brought into the city.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Nothing unclean will ever enter the city. No one who does shameful things or tells lies will ever enter the city. Only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life will enter the city. </div><ul class='tnav'>
