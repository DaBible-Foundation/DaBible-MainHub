So our high priest must also offer something to God.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>If our high priest were now living on earth, he would not be a priest. I say this because there are already priests here who follow the law by offering gifts to God.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The work that these priests do is really only a copy and a shadow of what is in heaven. That is why God warned Moses when he was ready to build the Holy Tent: “Be sure to make everything exactly like the pattern I showed you on the mountain.”<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Ex. 25:40.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But the work that has been given to Jesus is much greater than the work that was given to those priests. In the same way, the new agreement that Jesus brought from God to his people is much greater than the old one. And the new agreement is based on better promises. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>If there was nothing wrong with the first agreement, then there would be no need for a second agreement.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But God found something wrong with the people.
