<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 13</div><div class='s'>Obey Your Government Rulers </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>All of you must obey the government rulers. Everyone who rules was given the power to rule by God. And all those who rule now were given that power by God.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>So anyone who is against the government is really against something God has commanded. Those who are against the government bring punishment on themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>People who do right don’t have to fear the rulers. But those who do wrong must fear them. Do you want to be free from fearing them? Then do only what is right, and they will praise you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Rulers are God’s servants to help you. But if you do wrong, you have reason to be afraid. They have the power to punish, and they will use it. They are God’s servants to punish those who do wrong.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So you must obey the government, not just because you might be punished, but because you know it is the right thing to do. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And this is why you pay taxes too. Those rulers are working for God, and they give all their time to the work of ruling.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Give everyone what you owe them. If you owe them any kind of tax, then pay it. Show respect to those you should respect. And show honor to those you should honor. </div><div class='s'>Loving Others Is the Only Law </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>You should owe nothing to anyone, except that you will always owe love to each other. The person who loves others has done all that the law commands.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The law says, “You must not commit adultery, you must not murder anyone, you must not steal, you must not want what belongs to someone else.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Ex. 20:13-15, 17.</span></a> All these commands and all other commands are really only one rule: “Love your neighbor<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> your neighbor Or “others.” Jesus’ teaching in Lk. 10:25-37 makes clear that this includes anyone in need.</span></a> the same as you love yourself.”<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Lev. 19:18.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Love doesn’t hurt others. So loving is the same as obeying all the law. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I say this because you know that we live in an important time. Yes, it is now time for you to wake up from your sleep. Our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The night is almost finished. The day is almost here. So we should stop doing whatever belongs to darkness. We should prepare ourselves to fight evil with the weapons that belong to the light.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>We should live in a right way, like people who belong to the day. We should not have wild parties or be drunk. We should not be involved in sexual sin or any kind of immoral behavior. We should not cause arguments and trouble or be jealous.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But be like the Lord Jesus Christ, so that when people see what you do, they will see Christ. Don’t think about how to satisfy the desires of your sinful self. </div><ul class='tnav'>
