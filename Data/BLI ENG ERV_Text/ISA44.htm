The LORD All-Powerful is the one who will set Israel free. And he says, “I am the only God. There are no other gods.

They love their statues, which are useless. Those who serve as witnesses for these statues cannot even see. They don’t know enough to be ashamed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Who made these false gods? Who covered these useless statues?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Workers made them, and the workers are only human. If they all would come together before me, we could discuss this. Then they would all be ashamed and afraid. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>One worker uses his tools to heat iron over hot coals. Then he uses his hammer to beat the metal to shape it into a statue. He uses his own powerful arms, but when he gets hungry, he loses his strength.

He uses his calipers<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> calipers A special measuring tool, like a compass.</span></a> to measure the statue. In this way the worker makes the wood look exactly like a man, and this statue of a man does nothing but sit in the house. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>To split the cedar tree, the worker took some oak or cypress <span class='add'>wedges</span>. To make sure he had plenty of wood, he planted some pines. But it was the rain that made them grow. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>When the man wanted a fire, he took some of the wood to keep him warm. He also used some of it to bake his bread. But then he used that same wood to make a statue to worship as a god! That god is only a statue that he made, but he bows down to it!  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He burns half of the wood in the fire. He uses the fire to cook his meat, and he eats the meat until he is full. He burns the wood to keep himself warm. He says, “Good! Now I am warm, and I can see by the light of the fire.”  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>There is a little of the wood left, so he makes a statue and calls it his god.

They aren’t smart enough to think, “I burned half of the wood in the fire. I used the hot coals to bake my bread and cook the meat I ate.
