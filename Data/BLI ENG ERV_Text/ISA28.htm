No, he doesn’t work the soil all the time.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>A farmer prepares the ground, and then he plants the seed. He plants different kinds of seeds different ways. He scatters dill seeds, he throws cumin seeds on the ground, and he plants wheat in rows. A farmer plants barley in its special place, and he plants spelt seeds at the edge of his field. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Our God is using this to teach you a lesson. This example shows us that God is fair when he punishes his people.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Does a farmer use large boards with sharp teeth to crush dill seeds? No, and he doesn’t use a wagon to crush cumin seeds. A farmer uses a small stick to break the hulls from these seeds of grain.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>People grind grain to make flour, but they don’t grind it forever. As God does in punishing people, a worker might drive his wagon over the grain to remove the hulls, but he does not allow the horses<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> horses This word also means “horse soldiers.”</span></a> to crush it.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>This lesson comes from the LORD All-Powerful, who gives wonderful advice.
