Trust in God, and trust in me.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>There are many rooms in my Father’s house. I would not tell you this if it were not true. I am going there to prepare a place for you.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>After I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back. Then I will take you with me, so that you can be where I am.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>You know the way to the place where I am going.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Thomas said, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. The only way to the Father is through me.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>If you really knew me, you would know my Father too. But now you know the Father. You have seen him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father. That is all we need.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “Philip, I have been with you for a long time. So you should know me. Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father too. So why do you say, ‘Show us the Father’?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Don’t you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The things I have told you don’t come from me. The Father lives in me, and he is doing his own work.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me. Or believe because of the miracles I have done. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>“I can assure you that whoever believes in me will do the same things I have done. And they will do even greater things than I have done, because I am going to the Father.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And if you ask for anything in my name, I will do it for you. Then the Father’s glory will be shown through the Son.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>If you ask me for anything in my name, I will do it. </div><div class='s'>The Promise of the Holy Spirit </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>“If you love me, you will do what I command.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Helper Or “Comforter,” the Holy Spirit (see “Holy Spirit” in the Word List).

You will live because I live.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>On that day you will know that I am in the Father. You will know that you are in me and I am in you.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Those who really love me are the ones who not only know my commands but also obey them. My Father will love such people, and I will love them. I will make myself known to them.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, “Lord, how will you make yourself known to us, but not to the world?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “All who love me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them. My Father and I will come to them and live with them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But anyone who does not love me does not obey my teaching. This teaching that you hear is not really mine. It is from my Father who sent me. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>“I have told you all these things while I am with you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But the Helper will teach you everything and cause you to remember all that I told you.
