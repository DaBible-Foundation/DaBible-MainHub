And Israel’s unfaithful sister, Judah, saw what she did.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Israel was unfaithful, and she knew why I sent her away. Israel knew that I divorced her because she committed the sin of adultery. But that did not make her unfaithful sister afraid. Judah was not afraid. She also went out and acted like a prostitute.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Judah did not care that she was acting like a prostitute. So she made her country ‘dirty.’ She committed the sin of adultery by worshiping idols made out of stone and wood.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Israel’s unfaithful sister did not come back to me with her whole heart.
