He made it special because on that day he rested from all the work he did while creating the world. </div><div class='s'>The First Man and the Garden of Eden </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>This is the story about the creation of the sky and the earth. This is what happened when the LORD God made the earth and the sky.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>This was before there were plants on the earth. Nothing was growing in the fields because the LORD God had not yet made it rain on the earth, and there was no one to care for the plants. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So water<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> water Or “a mist.”</span></a> came up from the earth and spread over the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then the LORD God took dust from the ground and made a man.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> man The Hebrew word means “man,” “people,” or the name “Adam.” It is like the word meaning “earth” or “red clay.”</span></a> He breathed the breath of life into the man’s nose, and the man became a living thing.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then the LORD God planted a garden in the East,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> East This usually means the area between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers as far east as the Persian Gulf.</span></a> in a place named Eden. He put the man he made in that garden.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then the LORD God caused all the beautiful trees that were good for food to grow in the garden. In the middle of the garden, he put the tree of life and the tree that gives knowledge about good and evil. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>A river flowed from Eden and watered the garden. The river then separated and became four smaller rivers.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The name of the first river was Pishon. This river flowed around the entire country of Havilah.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Havilah The land along the west coast of the Arabian peninsula and possibly, the part of Africa south of Ethiopia.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>(There is gold in that country, and that gold is pure. A kind of expensive perfume and onyx are also found there.)  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The name of the second river was Gihon. This river flowed around the whole land of Cush.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Cush Usually this means Ethiopia, but here, it probably refers to the area north and east of the Tigris River.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The name of the third river was Tigris. This river flowed east of Assyria. The fourth river was the Euphrates. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The LORD God put the man in the Garden of Eden to work the soil and take care of the garden.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The LORD God gave him this command: “You may eat from any tree in the garden.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But you must not eat from the tree that gives knowledge about good and evil. If you eat fruit from that tree, on that day you will certainly die!” </div><div class='s'>A Companion for Adam </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then the LORD God said, “I see that it is not good for the man to be alone. I will make the companion he needs, one just right for him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The LORD God used dust from the ground and made every animal in the fields and every bird in the air. He brought all these animals to the man, and the man gave them all a name.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The man gave names to all the tame animals, to all the birds in the air, and to all the wild animals. He saw many animals and birds, but he could not find a companion that was right for him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So the LORD God caused the man to sleep very deeply. While he was asleep, God took one of the ribs from the man’s body. Then he closed the man’s skin where the rib had been.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The LORD God used the rib from the man to make a woman. Then he brought the woman to the man.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the man said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Finally! One like me, </div><div class='q2'>with bones from my bones </div><div class='q2'>and a body from my body. </div><div class='q'>She was taken out of a man, </div><div class='q2'>so I will call her ‘woman.’ ” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife. In this way two people become one. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The man and his wife were naked, but they were not ashamed. </div><ul class='tnav'>
