<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 5</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>You are God’s dear children, so try to be like him.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Live a life of love. Love others just as Christ loved us. He gave himself for us—a sweet-smelling offering and sacrifice to God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But there must be no sexual sin among you. There must not be any kind of evil or selfishly wanting more and more, because such things are not right for God’s holy people.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Also, there must be no evil talk among you. Don’t say things that are foolish or filthy. These are not for you. But you should be giving thanks to God.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>You can be sure of this: No one will have a place in the kingdom of Christ and of God if that person commits sexual sins, or does evil things, or is a person who selfishly wants more and more. A greedy person like that is serving a false god. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Don’t let anyone fool you with words that are not true. God gets very angry when people who don’t obey him talk like that.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So don’t have anything to do with them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>In the past you were full of darkness, but now you are full of light in the Lord. So live like children who belong to the light.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>This light produces every kind of goodness, right living, and truth.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Try to learn what pleases the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Have no part in the things that people in darkness do, which produce nothing good. Instead, tell everyone how wrong those things are.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Actually, it is shameful to even talk about the things those people do in secret.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But the light makes clear how wrong those things are.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Yes, everything is made clear by the light. This is why we say, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Wake up, you who are sleeping! </div><div class='q2'>Rise from death, </div><div class='q'>and Christ will shine on you.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So be very careful how you live. Live wisely, not like fools.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I mean that you should use every opportunity you have for doing good, because these are evil times.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So don’t be foolish with your lives, but learn what the Lord wants you to do.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Don’t be drunk with wine, which will ruin your life, but be filled with the Spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Encourage each other with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your hearts to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Always give thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. </div><div class='s'>Wives and Husbands </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Be willing to serve each other out of respect for Christ. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Wives, be willing to serve your husbands the same as the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>A husband is the head of his wife, just as Christ is the head of the church. Christ is the Savior of the church, which is his body.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The church serves under Christ, so it is the same with you wives. You should be willing to serve your husbands in everything. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Husbands, love your wives the same as Christ loved the church and gave his life for it.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He died to make the church holy. He used the telling of the Good News to make the church clean by washing it with water.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Christ died so that he could give the church to himself like a bride in all her beauty. He died so that the church could be holy and without fault, with no evil or sin or any other thing wrong in it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And husbands should love their wives like that. They should love their wives as they love their own bodies. The man who loves his wife loves himself,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>because no one ever hates his own body, but feeds and takes care of it. And that is what Christ does for the church  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>because we are parts of his body.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The Scriptures say, “That is why a man will leave his father and mother and join his wife, and the two people will become one.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Gen. 2:24.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>That secret truth is very important—I am talking about Christ and the church.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But each one of you must love his wife as he loves himself. And a wife must respect her husband. </div><ul class='tnav'>
