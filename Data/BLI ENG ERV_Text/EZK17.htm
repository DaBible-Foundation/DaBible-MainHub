He said,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>“Explain this story to the people of Israel who always turn against me. Tell them this: The first eagle is the king of Babylonia. He came to Jerusalem and took away the king and other leaders. He brought them to Babylonia.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar made an agreement with a man from the king’s family. Nebuchadnezzar forced that man to make a promise. So this man promised to be loyal to Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuchadnezzar made this man the new king of Judah. Then he took all the powerful men away from Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So Judah became a weak kingdom that could not turn against King Nebuchadnezzar. The people were forced to keep the agreement Nebuchadnezzar made with the new king of Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But this new king tried to rebel against Nebuchadnezzar anyway! He sent messengers to Egypt to ask for help. The new king asked for many horses and soldiers. Now, do you think the new king of Judah will succeed? Do you think the new king will have enough power to break the agreement and escape punishment?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The Lord GOD says, “By my life, I swear that this new king will die in Babylonia! Nebuchadnezzar made this man the new king of Judah, but he broke his promise with Nebuchadnezzar. This new king ignored that agreement.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The king of Egypt will not be able to save the king of Judah. He might send many soldiers, but Egypt’s great power will not save Judah. Nebuchadnezzar’s army will build dirt roads and dirt walls to capture the city. Many people will die.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But the king of Judah will not escape, because he ignored his agreement. He broke his promise to Nebuchadnezzar.”  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The Lord GOD makes this promise: “By my life, I swear that I will punish the king of Judah, because he ignored my warnings and broke our agreement.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>I will set my trap, and he will be caught in it. Then I will bring him to Babylon, and I will punish him there. I will punish him because he turned against me,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and I will destroy his army. I will destroy his best soldiers and scatter them to the wind. Then you will know that I am the LORD and that I told you these things.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“I will take a branch from a tall cedar tree. </div><div class='q2'>I will take a small branch from the top of the tree, </div><div class='q2'>and I myself will plant it on a very high mountain. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>I myself will plant it on a high mountain in Israel. </div><div class='q2'>That branch will grow into a tree. </div><div class='q'>It will grow branches and make fruit </div><div class='q2'>and become a beautiful cedar tree. </div><div class='q'>Many birds will sit on its branches </div><div class='q2'>and live in the shadows under its branches. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>“Then the other trees will know that </div><div class='q2'>I, the LORD, make tall trees fall to the ground, </div><div class='q2'>and I make small trees grow tall. </div><div class='q'>I make green trees become dry, </div><div class='q2'>and I make dry trees become green. </div><div class='q'>I am the LORD. </div><div class='q2'>If I say that I will do something, then I will do it!” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><ul class='tnav'>
