Also in verse 17.</span></a> speak against Gog for me. Tell him that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Gog, you are the most important leader of the countries Meshech and Tubal, but I am against you.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I will capture you and bring you back. I will bring you from the far north. I will bring you to fight against the mountains of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But I will knock your bow from your left hand and your arrows from your right hand.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>You will be killed on the mountains of Israel. You, your groups of soldiers, and all the other nations with you will be killed in the battle. I will give you as food to every kind of bird that eats meat and to all the wild animals.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>You will not enter the city. You will be killed out in the open fields. I have spoken!’ ” This is what the Lord GOD said. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>“I will send fire against Magog and those people living along the coast. They think they are safe, but they will know that I am the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And I will make my holy name known among my people Israel. I will not let people ruin my holy name anymore. The nations will know that I am the LORD. They will know that I am the Holy One in Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>That time is coming! It will happen!” This is what the Lord GOD said. “That is the day I am talking about. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“At that time people living in the cities of Israel will go out to the fields. They will collect the enemy’s weapons and burn them. They will burn all the shields, bows and arrows, clubs and spears. They will use the weapons as firewood for seven years.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They will not have to gather wood from the fields or chop firewood from the forests because they will use the weapons as firewood. They will take the valuable things from the soldiers who wanted to steal from them. They will take the good things from the soldiers who took good things from them.” This is what the Lord GOD said. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>“At that time I will choose a place in Israel to bury Gog. He will be buried in the Valley of the Travelers,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Valley of the Travelers This is a wordplay on the name Arabah Valley.</span></a> east of the Dead Sea. It will block the road for travelers, because Gog and all his army will be buried in that place. People will call it ‘The Valley of Gog’s Army.’  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>It will take seven months for the family of Israel to bury them. They must do this to make the land pure.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The common people will bury the enemy soldiers, and the people will become famous on the day that I bring honor to myself.” The Lord GOD said those things. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>“Workers will be given a full-time job burying the dead soldiers to make the land pure. The workers will work for seven months. They will go around looking for dead bodies.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>They will go around looking, and if anyone sees a bone, a marker will be put up by it. The sign will stay there until the gravediggers come and bury the bone in the Valley of Gog’s Army.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The city of the dead will be named Hamonah.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Hamonah This Hebrew word means “crowd.”</span></a> In this way they will make the country pure.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>This is what the Lord GOD said: “Son of man, speak to all the birds and wild animals for me. Tell them, ‘Come here! Come here! Gather around. Come eat this sacrifice I am preparing for you. There will be a very big sacrifice on the mountains of Israel. Come, eat the meat and drink the blood.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>You will eat the meat from the bodies of powerful soldiers and drink the blood from world leaders. They will be like rams, lambs, goats, and fat bulls from Bashan.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>You can eat all the fat you want and drink blood until you are full. You will eat and drink from my sacrifice, which I will kill for you.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>You will have plenty of meat to eat at my table. There will be horses and chariot drivers, powerful soldiers, and all the other fighting men.’ ” This is what the Lord GOD said. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>“I will let the other nations see what I have done, and they will begin to respect me! They will see my power that I used against the enemy.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then from that day on, the family of Israel will know that I am the LORD their God.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the nations will know why the family of Israel was carried away as prisoners to other countries. They will learn that my people turned against me, so I turned away from them. I let their enemies defeat them, so my people were killed in battle.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>They sinned and made themselves filthy, so I punished them for the things they did. I turned away from them and refused to help them.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So this is what the Lord GOD says: “Now I will bring the family of Jacob back from captivity. I will have mercy on the whole family of Israel. I will show my strong feelings for my holy name.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The people will forget their shame and all the times they turned against me. They will live in safety on their own land. No one will make them afraid.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>I will bring my people back from other countries. I will gather them from the lands of their enemies. Then many nations will see how holy I am.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>They will know that I am the LORD their God. That is because I made them leave their homes and go as prisoners to other countries. But then I gathered them together again and brought them back to their own land.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>I will pour out my Spirit on the family of Israel, and I will never turn away from my people again.” This is what the Lord GOD said. </div><ul class='tnav'>
