<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 17</div><div class='s'>Jesus Is Seen With Moses and Elijah </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 9:2–13; Lk. 9:28–36) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John the brother of James and went up on a high mountain. They were all alone there.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>While these followers watched him, Jesus was changed. His face became bright like the sun, and his clothes became white as light.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then two men were there, talking with him. They were Moses and Elijah. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good that we are here. If you want, I will put three tents here—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>While Peter was talking, a bright cloud came over them. A voice came from the cloud and said, “This is my Son, the one I love. I am very pleased with him. Obey him!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The followers with Jesus heard this voice. They were very afraid, so they fell to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But Jesus came to them and touched them. He said, “Stand up. Don’t be afraid.”  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The followers looked up, and they saw that Jesus was now alone. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>As Jesus and the followers were coming down the mountain, he gave them this command: “Don’t tell anyone about what you saw on the mountain. Wait until the Son of Man has been raised from death. Then you can tell people about what you saw.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The followers asked Jesus, “Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Elijah must come See Mal. 4:5-6.</span></a> before the Messiah comes?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “They are right to say Elijah is coming. And it is true that Elijah will make all things the way they should be.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But I tell you, Elijah has already come. People did not know who he was, and they treated him badly, doing whatever they wanted to do. It is the same with the Son of Man. Those same people will make the Son of Man suffer.”  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then the followers understood that when Jesus said Elijah, he was really talking about John the Baptizer. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Frees a Boy From an Evil Spirit </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 9:14–29; Lk. 9:37–43a) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Jesus and the followers went back to the people. A man came to Jesus and bowed before him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The man said, “Lord, be kind to my son. He suffers so much from the seizures he has. He often falls into the fire or into the water.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I brought him to your followers, but they could not heal him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “You people today have no faith. Your lives are so wrong! How long must I stay with you? How long must I continue to be patient with you? Bring the boy here.”  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Jesus gave a strong command to the demon inside the boy. The demon came out of the boy, and the boy was healed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then the followers came to Jesus alone. They said, “We tried to force the demon out of the boy, but we could not. Why were we not able to make the demon go out?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “You were not able to make the demon go out, because your faith is too small. Believe me when I tell you, if your faith is only as big as a mustard seed you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. You will be able to do anything.”  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Some Greek copies add verse 21: “But that kind of spirit comes out only with prayer and fasting.”</span></a> </div><div class='s'>Jesus Talks About His Death </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 9:30–32; Lk. 9:43b–45) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Later, the followers met together in Galilee. Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man will be handed over to the control of other men,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>who will kill him. But on the third day he will be raised from death.” The followers were very sad to hear that Jesus would be killed. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Teaches About Paying Taxes </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Jesus and his followers went to Capernaum. There the men who collect the two-drachma Temple tax came to Peter and asked, “Does your teacher pay the Temple tax?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Peter answered, “Yes, he does.” </div><div class='p'>Peter went into the house where Jesus was. Before Peter could speak, Jesus said to him, “The kings on the earth get different kinds of taxes from people. But who are those who pay the taxes? Are they the king’s children? Or do other people pay the taxes? What do you think?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Peter answered, “The other people pay the taxes.” </div><div class='p'>Jesus said, “Then the children of the king don’t have to pay taxes.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But we don’t want to upset these tax collectors. So do this: Go to the lake and fish. After you catch the first fish, open its mouth. Inside its mouth you will find a four-drachma coin. Take that coin and give it to the tax collectors. That will pay the tax for you and me.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
