</div><hr /><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Greetings from Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus. </div><div class='p'>God chose me to be an apostle and gave me the work of telling his Good News.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>God promised long ago through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures to give this Good News to his people.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3-4&#160;</span>The Good News is about God’s Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. As a human, he was born from the family of David, but through the Holy Spirit<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Holy Spirit Literally, “spirit of holiness.”</span></a> he was shown to be God’s powerful Son when he was raised from death. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Through Christ, God gave me the special work of an apostle—to lead people of all nations to believe and obey him. I do all this to honor Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>You are some of those who have been chosen to belong to Jesus Christ. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>This letter is to all of you in Rome. God loves you, and he has chosen you to be his holy people. </div><div class='p'>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. </div><div class='s'>A Prayer of Thanks </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>First I want to say that I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you. I thank him because people everywhere in the world are talking about your great faith.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9-10&#160;</span>Every time I pray, I always remember you. God knows this is true. He is the one I serve with all my heart by telling people the Good News about his Son. I pray that I will be allowed to come to you. It will happen if God wants it.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I want very much to see you and give you some spiritual gift to make your faith stronger.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I mean that I want us to help each other with the faith that we have. Your faith will help me, and my faith will help you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Brothers and sisters, I want you to know that I have planned many times to come to you, but something always happens to change my plans. I would like to see the same good result among you that I have had from my work among the other non-Jewish people. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I must serve all people—those who share in Greek culture and those who are less civilized,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> those who share … civilized Literally, “Greeks and barbarians.” See “Greek” in the Word List.</span></a> the educated as well as the ignorant.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>That is why I want so much to tell the Good News to you there in Rome. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I am proud of the Good News, because it is the power God uses to save everyone who believes—to save the Jews first, and now to save those who are not Jews.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The Good News shows how God makes people right with himself. God’s way of making people right begins and ends with faith. As the Scriptures say, “The one who is right with God by faith will live forever.”<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Hab. 2:4.</span></a> </div><div class='s'>All People Have Done Wrong </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>God shows his anger from heaven against all the evil and wrong things that people do. Their evil lives hide the truth they have.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>This makes God angry because they have been shown what he is like. Yes, God has made it clear to them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>There are things about God that people cannot see—his eternal power and all that makes him God. But since the beginning of the world, those things have been easy for people to understand. They are made clear in what God has made. So people have no excuse for the evil they do. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>People knew God, but they did not honor him as God, and they did not thank him. Their ideas were all useless. There was not one good thought left in their foolish minds.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>They said they were wise, but they became fools.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Instead of honoring the divine greatness of God, who lives forever, they traded it for the worship of idols—things made to look like humans, who get sick and die, or like birds, animals, and snakes. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>People wanted only to do evil. So God left them and let them go their sinful way. And so they became completely immoral and used their bodies in shameful ways with each other.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>They traded the truth of God for a lie. They bowed down and worshiped the things God made instead of worshiping the God who made those things. He is the one who should be praised forever. Amen. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Because people did those things, God left them and let them do the shameful things they wanted to do. Women stopped having natural sex with men and started having sex with other women.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>In the same way, men stopped having natural sex with women and began wanting each other all the time. Men did shameful things with other men, and in their bodies they received the punishment for those wrongs. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>People did not think it was important to have a true knowledge of God. So God left them and allowed them to have their own worthless thinking. And so they do what they should not do.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>They are filled with every kind of sin, evil, greed, and hatred. They are full of jealousy, murder, fighting, lying, and thinking the worst things about each other. They gossip  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>and say evil things about each other. They hate God. They are rude, proud, and brag about themselves. They invent ways of doing evil. They don’t obey their parents,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>they are foolish, they don’t keep their promises, and they show no kindness or mercy to others.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>They know God’s law says that anyone who lives like that should die. But they not only continue to do these things themselves, but they also encourage others who do them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
