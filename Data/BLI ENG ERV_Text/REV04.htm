<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 4</div><div class='s'>John Sees Heaven </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then I looked, and there before me was an open door in heaven. And I heard the same voice that spoke to me before. It was the voice that sounded like a trumpet. It said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after this.”  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Immediately the Spirit took control of me, and there in heaven was a throne with someone sitting on it.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The one sitting there was as beautiful as precious stones, like jasper and carnelian. All around the throne was a rainbow with clear colors like an emerald. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>In a circle around the throne were 24 other thrones with 24 elders sitting on them. The elders were dressed in white, and they had golden crowns on their heads.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Lightning flashes and noises of thunder came from the throne. Before the throne there were seven lamps burning, which are the seven Spirits of God.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Also before the throne there was something that looked like a sea of glass, as clear as crystal. </div><div class='p'>In front of the throne and on each side of it there were four living beings. They had eyes all over them, in front and in back.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The first living being was like a lion. The second was like a bull. The third had a face like a man. The fourth was like a flying eagle.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Each of these four living beings had six wings. They were covered all over with eyes, inside and out. Day and night they never stopped saying, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God All-Powerful. </div><div class='q2'>He always was, he is, and he is coming.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>These living beings were giving glory and honor and thanks to the one who sits on the throne, the one who lives forever and ever. And every time they did this,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>the 24 elders bowed down before the one who sits on the throne. They worshiped him who lives forever and ever. They put their crowns down before the throne and said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>“Our Lord and God! </div><div class='q2'>You are worthy to receive glory and honor and power. </div><div class='q'>You made all things. </div><div class='q2'>Everything existed and was made because you wanted it.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><ul class='tnav'>
