Your legs will become weak and bent. Your teeth will fall out, and you will not be able to chew your food. Your eyes will not see clearly.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>You will become hard of hearing. You will not hear the noise in the streets. Even the stone grinding your grain will seem quiet to you. You will not be able to hear the women singing. But even the sound of a bird singing will wake you early in the morning because you will not be able to sleep. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>You will be afraid of high places. You will be afraid of tripping over every small thing in your path. Your hair will become white like the flowers on an almond tree. You will drag yourself along like a grasshopper when you walk. You will lose your desire,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> desire Or “appetite” or “sexual desire.” The Hebrew text here is hard to understand.</span></a> and then you will go to your eternal home.

When these sayings are written down and saved, they can be used to guide people, just as a shepherd uses a sharp stick to make his sheep go the right way.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So, son, study these sayings, but be careful about other teachings. People are always writing books, and too much study will make you very tired. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13-14&#160;</span>Now, what should we learn from everything that is written in this book?<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Now … book Literally, “The sum of the matter, when all is heard, is ….”</span></a> The most important thing a person can do is to respect God and obey his commands, because he knows about everything people do—even the secret things. He knows about all the good and all the bad, and he will judge people for everything they do. </div><ul class='tnav'>
