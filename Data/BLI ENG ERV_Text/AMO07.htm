This was at the time the second crop began to grow, after the king’s people had cut the first crop.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Before the locusts could eat all the grass in the country, I said, “Lord GOD, I beg you, forgive us! Jacob cannot survive! He is too small!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then the LORD changed his mind about this. The LORD said, “It will not happen.” </div><div class='s'>The Vision of the Fire </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>This is what the Lord GOD showed me: I saw the Lord GOD calling for judgment by fire.

He has been speaking so much that this country cannot hold all his words.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Amos has said, ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword, and the people of Israel will be taken as prisoners out of their country.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Amaziah also said to Amos, “You seer, go down to Judah and eat there.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> eat there This shows that Amaziah thought that Amos was a professional prophet who prophesied to receive food or money.</span></a> Do your prophesying there.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But don’t prophesy anymore here at Bethel. This is Jeroboam’s holy place. This is Israel’s temple.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then Amos answered Amaziah, “I am not a professional prophet, and I am not from a prophet’s family. I raise cattle and take care of sycamore trees.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I was a shepherd and the LORD took me from following the sheep. The LORD said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So listen to the LORD’S message. You tell me, ‘Don’t prophesy against Israel.
