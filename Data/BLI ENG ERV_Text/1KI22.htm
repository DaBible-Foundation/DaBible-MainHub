<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 22</div><div class='s'>Micaiah Warns King Ahab </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>For the next two years there was peace between Israel and Aram.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then during the third year, King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to visit King Ahab of Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Ahab asked his officials, “Remember when the king of Aram took Ramoth Gilead from us? That city is ours, so why have we done nothing to get it back?”  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>So Ahab asked King Jehoshaphat, “Will you join with us to go fight the Arameans at Ramoth Gilead?” </div><div class='p'>Jehoshaphat answered, “Yes, you and I will be as one—my men and my horses will be as yours.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But first let’s ask the LORD for advice.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So Ahab called a meeting of the prophets. There were about 400 prophets at that time. Ahab asked the prophets, “Should I go and attack the Arameans at Ramoth Gilead or not?” </div><div class='p'>The prophets answered Ahab, “Yes, because the Lord will let you defeat Ramoth Gilead.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But Jehoshaphat said, “Doesn’t the LORD have another prophet here? Let’s ask him the same question.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>King Ahab answered, “Yes, there is another prophet. His name is Micaiah son of Imlah. But I hate him because he will not say anything good about me when he speaks for the LORD. He always says things that I don’t like.” </div><div class='p'>Jehoshaphat said, “The king should not say that!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So King Ahab told one of his officers to go and find Micaiah. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>At that time the two kings were sitting on their thrones, with their royal robes on, at the judgment place near the gates of Samaria. All the prophets were standing before them, prophesying.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>One of the prophets was named Zedekiah son of Kenaanah. Zedekiah made some iron horns<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> iron horns These were a symbol of great strength.</span></a> and said to Ahab, “The LORD says, ‘You will use these iron horns to fight against the army of Aram. You will defeat them and destroy them.’ ”  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>All the other prophets agreed with Zedekiah and said, “Your army should march now to go fight against the Arameans at Ramoth Gilead. You will win the battle. The LORD will let you defeat them.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>While this was happening, the officer went to find Micaiah. When he found him, the officer told him, “All the other prophets have said that the king will succeed, so you should say the same thing.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But Micaiah answered, “As surely as the LORD lives, I can say only what the LORD says.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Micaiah went and stood before King Ahab. The king asked him, “Micaiah, should we go and attack the Arameans at Ramoth Gilead or not?” </div><div class='p'>Micaiah answered, “Yes, go and be successful! The LORD will let you take the city.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But Ahab answered, “How many times do I have to tell you? Tell me the truth. What does the LORD say?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So Micaiah answered, “I can see the army of Israel scattered all over the hills, like sheep with no one to lead them. This is what the LORD says: ‘These men have no leaders. Let them go home in peace.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “See, I told you! This prophet never says anything good about me. He always says something bad.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But Micaiah said, “Listen to this message from the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne. All of heaven’s army was standing around him, some on his left side and some on his right side.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The LORD said, ‘Which of you will go fool Ahab into attacking the Arameans at Ramoth Gilead so that he will be killed?’ The angels discussed many different plans.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then a spirit<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> a spirit Or “the Spirit.”</span></a> went and stood before the LORD and said, ‘I will fool him!’ The LORD asked, ‘How will you do it?’  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The spirit answered, ‘I will go to Ahab’s prophets and cause them to tell lies.’ So the Lord said, ‘Yes, that will fool Ahab. Go out and do that.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>“So that is what has happened here. The LORD made your prophets lie to you. The LORD himself decided to bring this disaster to you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then the prophet Zedekiah went to Micaiah and hit him on the face. Zedekiah said, “How is it that the Spirit of the LORD left me to speak through you?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Micaiah answered, “Look, what I said will happen! And you will see it one day when you are in a secret room somewhere hiding.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then King Ahab ordered one of his officers to arrest Micaiah. Ahab said, “Arrest him and take him to Amon the governor of the city and prince Joash.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Tell them to put Micaiah in prison. Give him nothing but bread and water to eat. Keep him there until I come home from the battle.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Micaiah said, “Listen to me, everyone! Ahab, if you come back alive from the battle, the LORD has not spoken through me.” </div><div class='s'>The Battle at Ramoth Gilead </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to fight the Arameans at Ramoth Gilead.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Disguise yourself when you go into battle, but wear your own clothes. And I will disguise myself.” The king of Israel went into battle dressed like an ordinary soldier. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The king of Aram had 32 chariot commanders. He gave them this command, “Don’t go after anyone except the king of Israel, no matter how important they are.”  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>When the commanders saw King Jehoshaphat, they thought he was the king of Israel, and so they went to kill him. Jehoshaphat started shouting.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>When the commanders saw that he was not King Ahab, they stopped chasing him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then a soldier in the distance pulled back as far as he could on his bow and shot an arrow into the air. The arrow happened to hit the king of Israel in a small hole where his armor was fastened together. King Ahab said to his chariot driver, “I’ve been hit! Turn the chariot around and take me off the battlefield!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>The armies continued to fight while King Ahab was propped up in his chariot. He was leaning against the sides of the chariot, looking out toward the Arameans. His blood ran down onto the floor of the chariot. Later in the evening, he died.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>At sunset all the Israelites cheered when they were told to go home. So they all went back to their hometowns. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And that is how King Ahab died. Some men carried his body to Samaria and buried him there.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>They took his chariot to the large pool in Samaria to clean it. The dogs licked up Ahab’s blood while the prostitutes washed the chariot. This happened just as the LORD said it would. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>The rest of what King Ahab did during the time he ruled is written in the book, <span class='bk'>The History of the Kings of Israel</span>. That book tells about all the cities he built and about all the ivory that he used to decorate his palace.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Ahab died and was buried with his ancestors. His son Ahaziah became the next king after him. </div><div class='s'>Summary of Jehoshaphat’s Rule </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Jehoshaphat son of Asa became the king of Judah in Ahab’s fourth year as king of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Jehoshaphat was 35 years old when he became king, and he ruled in Jerusalem for 25 years. His mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Like his father Asa, Jehoshaphat was good and did everything that the LORD wanted, but he did not destroy the high places. The people continued offering sacrifices and burning incense there. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Jehoshaphat made a peace agreement with the king of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Jehoshaphat was very brave and fought many wars. The rest of what he did is written in the book, <span class='bk'>The History of the Kings of Judah</span>. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Jehoshaphat forced all the men and women who sold their bodies for sex to leave the places of worship. They had served in these places of worship while his father Asa was king. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>In those days Edom did not have a king; it was ruled by a governor who was chosen by the king of Judah. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>King Jehoshaphat built some cargo ships. He wanted the ships to sail to Ophir for gold, but they never went there—they were destroyed in their home port at Ezion Geber.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Then King Ahaziah of Israel offered to put some of his own sailors with Jehoshaphat’s men on the ships,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> King Ahaziah … ships Jehoshaphat controlled the port of Ezion Geber which was Israel’s only way to the Red Sea and the coasts of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and the coasts leading to the Persian Gulf and India. Ahaziah thought he could get control of that area by “helping” Jehoshaphat.</span></a> but Jehoshaphat refused to accept his help. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Jehoshaphat died and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. Then his son Jehoram became the next king. </div><div class='s'>Ahaziah, King of Israel </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Ahaziah was the son of Ahab. He became king of Israel during the 17th year that King Jehoshaphat ruled Judah. Ahaziah ruled in Samaria for two years.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>He sinned against the LORD just as his parents, Ahab and Jezebel, did. He caused Israel to sin just as Jeroboam son of Nebat did.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>Ahaziah served the false god Baal and worshiped him, just as his father did before him. He did all the things that his father did to make the LORD, the God of Israel, angry. </div><ul class='tnav'>
