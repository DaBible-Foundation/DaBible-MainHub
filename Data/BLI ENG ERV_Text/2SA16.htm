<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 16</div><div class='s'>Ziba Meets David </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>David went a short way over the top of the Mount of Olives and met Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth. Ziba had two donkeys with saddles on them. The donkeys also carried 200 loaves of bread, 100 bunches of raisins, 100 summer fruits, and a wineskin full of wine.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>King David said to Ziba, “What are these things for?” </div><div class='p'>Ziba answered, “The donkeys are for the king’s family to ride on. The bread and the summer fruit are for the servants to eat. And the wine is refreshment for whoever begins to feel weak in the desert.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then the king asked, “And where is Mephibosheth<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Mephibosheth Literally, “your master’s grandson.”</span></a>?” </div><div class='p'>Ziba answered the king, “Mephibosheth is staying in Jerusalem. He said, ‘Today the Israelites will give my father’s kingdom back to me.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then the king said to Ziba, “All right, I now give you everything that belonged to Mephibosheth.” </div><div class='p'>Ziba said, “I bow to you. I pray I will always be able to please you.” </div><div class='s'>Shimei Curses David </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>As David came to Bahurim, a man from Saul’s family, Shimei son of Gera, came out cursing David again and again. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Shimei began throwing stones at David and his officers. Both the people and the soldiers gathered around David to protect him—they were all around him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Shimei cursed David. He said, “Get out, get out, you no-good murderer<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> murderer Literally, “man of blood.”</span></a>!  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The LORD is punishing you because you killed people in Saul’s family. You stole Saul’s place as king. But now the same bad things are happening to you. The LORD has given the kingdom to your son Absalom, because you are a murderer.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dying dog curse you, my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off Shimei’s head.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But the king answered, “What can I do, sons of Zeruiah? Yes, Shimei is cursing me, but the LORD told him to curse me. And who can ask him why he did that?”  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>David also said to Abishai and all his servants, “Look, my very own son is trying to kill me, so why shouldn’t this man from the tribe of Benjamin want to do the same? Leave him alone. Let him continue to curse me. The LORD told him to do this.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Maybe the LORD will see the wrong things that are happening to me and give me something good for every bad thing that Shimei says today.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So David and his men went on their way down the road. Shimei kept following David. He walked on the other side of the road by the side of the hill. He kept cursing David on his way. Shimei also threw stones and dirt at David. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>King David and all his people came to the Jordan River. They were tired, so they rested and refreshed themselves there. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Meanwhile, Absalom, Ahithophel, and all the Israelites came to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>David’s friend, Hushai the Arkite, came to Absalom and told him, “Long live the king! Long live the king!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Absalom answered, “Why are you not loyal to your friend David? Why did you not leave Jerusalem with your friend?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Hushai said, “I belong to the one that the LORD chooses. These people and the people of Israel chose you. I will stay with you.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>In the past, I served your father. So now I will serve you, David’s son.” </div><div class='s'>Absalom Asks Ahithophel for Advice </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Please tell us what we should do.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Your father left some of his slave women here to take care of the house. Go and have sexual relations with them. Then all the Israelites will hear how you humiliated your father, and they will be encouraged to give you more support.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then they put up a tent for Absalom up on the roof of the house. Absalom had sexual relations with his father’s wives<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> wives Or “concubines.” See “slave woman” in the Word List.</span></a> so that all the Israelites could see what happened.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So in those days Ahithophel’s advice was very important. Both David and Absalom accepted his advice as though it were the word of God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
