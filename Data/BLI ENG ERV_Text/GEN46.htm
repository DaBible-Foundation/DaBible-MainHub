First he went to Beersheba. There he worshiped God, the God of his father Isaac. He offered sacrifices.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>During the night God spoke to Israel in a dream and said, “Jacob, Jacob.” </div><div class='p'>Israel answered, “Here I am.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then God said, “I am God, the God of your father. Don’t be afraid to go to Egypt. In Egypt I will make you a great nation.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I will go to Egypt with you, and I will bring you out of Egypt again. You will die there, but Joseph will be with you. His own hands will close your eyes when you die.” </div><div class='s'>Israel Goes to Egypt </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then Jacob left Beersheba and traveled to Egypt. His sons, the sons of Israel, brought their father, their wives, and all their children to Egypt. They traveled in the wagons the Pharaoh had sent.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>They also had their cattle and everything they owned in the land of Canaan. So Israel went to Egypt with all his children and his family.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>With him were his sons and his grandsons, his daughters and his granddaughters. All of his family went with him. </div><div class='s'>The Family of Jacob (Israel) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>These are the names of Israel’s sons and family who went to Egypt with him: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='li'>Reuben was Jacob’s first son.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Reuben’s sons were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Simeon’s sons were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, and Zohar.

Judah went to Joseph in the land of Goshen. Then Jacob and his people followed into the land.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Joseph learned that his father was coming.

I will say to Pharaoh, ‘My brothers and the rest of my father’s family have left the land of Canaan and have come here to me.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>They are a family of shepherds. They have always kept sheep and cattle. They have brought all their animals and everything they own with them.’  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>When Pharaoh calls you, he will ask, ‘What work do you do?’  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>You tell him, ‘We are shepherds.
