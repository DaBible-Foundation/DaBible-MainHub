If the man kills the animal or sells it, then he cannot give it back. So he must pay five bulls for the one he stole. Or he must pay four sheep for the one he stole. He must pay for stealing.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2-4&#160;</span>If he owns nothing, then he will be sold as a slave. But if the man still has the animal and you find it, that man must give the owner two animals for every animal he stole. It doesn’t matter if the animal was a bull, a donkey, or a sheep. </div><div class='p'>“If a thief is killed while trying to break into a house at night, then no one will be guilty for killing him. But if this happens during the day, the one who killed him will be guilty of murder. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“A man might let his animal loose to graze in his field or vineyard. If the animal wanders into another person’s field or vineyard, then the owner must pay. The payment must come from the best of his crop.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Or “A man might start a fire in his field or vineyard. If he lets the fire spread and it burns his neighbor’s field or vineyard, he must use his best crops to pay his neighbor for his loss.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>“A man might start a fire to burn thornbushes on his field. But if the fire grows and burns his neighbor’s crops or the grain growing on the neighbor’s field, the man who started the fire must pay for what he burned. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>“Someone might give some money or tools to a neighbor for safekeeping. What should you do if someone steals those things from the neighbor’s house? If you find the one who stole them, then that thief must pay twice as much as the things are worth.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>If you don’t find the thief, then the owner of the house must go before the judges<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> judges Or “God.” Also in verse 9.</span></a> who will decide if that person is guilty. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“What should you do if two men disagree about a bull or a donkey or sheep or clothing or something that is lost? One man says, ‘This is mine,’ and the other says, ‘No, it is mine.’ Both men should go before the judges who will decide who is guilty. The one who was wrong must pay the other man twice as much as the thing is worth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>“A man might ask his neighbor to take care of an animal for a short time. It might be a donkey, a bull, or a sheep. But what should you do if that animal is hurt or dies or someone takes the animal while no one is looking?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>That neighbor must explain that he did not steal the animal. If this is true, the neighbor will promise to the LORD that he did not steal it. The owner of the animal must accept this promise. The neighbor does not have to pay the owner for the animal.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But if the neighbor stole the animal, then he must pay the owner for the animal.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>If wild animals killed the animal, then the neighbor should bring the body as proof. The neighbor will not have to pay the owner for the animal that was killed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>“If a man borrows an animal from his neighbor, and the animal is hurt or dies, then the neighbor must pay the owner for the animal. The neighbor is responsible, because the owner was not there himself.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But if the owner was there, then the neighbor does not have to pay. Or if the neighbor was paying money to use the animal for work, he will not have to pay if the animal dies or is hurt. The money he paid to use the animal will be enough payment. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>“If a man has sexual relations with a virgin who he is not engaged to,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> a virgin … engaged to Literally, “a virgin who is not engaged.”</span></a> then he must pay her father the full amount necessary to marry her.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If the father refuses to allow his daughter to marry him, then the man must still pay the full amount for her. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>“You must not allow any woman to do evil magic.
