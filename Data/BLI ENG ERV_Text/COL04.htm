Be ready for anything by praying and being thankful.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Also pray for us. Pray that God will give us an opportunity to tell people his message. I am in prison for doing this. But pray that we can continue to tell people the secret truth that God has made known about Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Pray that I will say what is necessary to make this truth clear to everyone. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Be wise in the way you act with those who are not believers. Use your time in the best way you can.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>When you talk, you should always be kind and wise.

If he comes, welcome him.)  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And greetings from Jesus, the one who is also called Justus.
