Ephraim spoke and people shook with fear. But Ephraim sinned by worshiping Baal, so he must die.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Now the Israelites sin more and more. They make idols for themselves. Workers make those fancy statues from silver, and then they talk to their statues. They offer sacrifices to them, and they kiss those calf idols.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>That is why those people will soon disappear. They will be like a fog that comes early in the morning and then quickly disappears. The Israelites will be like chaff that is blown from the threshing floor. The Israelites will be like smoke that goes out a window and disappears. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>“I have been the LORD your God since the time you were in the land of Egypt. You did not know any other god except me. I am the one who saved you.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I knew you in the desert—I knew you in that dry land.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I gave food to the Israelites, and they ate it. They became full and satisfied. They became proud, and then they forgot me. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>“That is why I will be like a lion to them. I will be like a leopard waiting by the road.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I will attack them like a bear whose cubs were robbed from her. I will attack them and rip open their chests. I will be like a lion or other wild animal tearing and eating its prey. </div><div class='s'>Israel Cannot Be Saved From God’s Anger </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“Israel, I helped you, but you turned against me. So now I will destroy you.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Where is your king? Can he save you in any of your cities? Where are your judges?
