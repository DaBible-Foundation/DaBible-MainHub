You must give back whatever you stole or whatever you took by cheating. You must return whatever you took that another person asked you to hold, or whatever you found and lied about having,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>or whatever you made a false promise about. You must pay the full price and then add one-fifth of that amount as a fine and give it all to the true owner.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>You must also bring a ram to the LORD that has nothing wrong with it (or the same amount in silver) to the priest.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then the priest will go to the LORD to make you pure, and God will forgive you for whichever of these things you did that made you guilty.” </div><div class='s'>Burnt Offerings </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The LORD said to Moses,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“Give this command to Aaron and his sons: This is the law of the burnt offering. The burnt offering must stay on the hearth<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> hearth The place on an altar or in a fireplace where a fire is burned.</span></a> of the altar all night until morning. The altar’s fire must be kept burning.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The priest must change clothes and put on the special linen underwear and linen robe. Then he must gather up the ashes from the fire and burnt offerings and set them down by the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then he must take off the special clothes and put on the other clothes and carry the ashes outside the camp to a special place that is pure.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The fire that was started on the altar must never be allowed to stop burning. Every morning the priests must put wood on the altar. They must arrange the burnt offerings on the wood, and they must burn the fat of the fellowship offerings on it.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>That fire must always be kept burning on the altar. It must never be allowed to stop burning. </div><div class='s'>Grain Offerings </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>“This is the law for the grain offering: The sons of Aaron will bring it to the front of the altar as an offering to the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>There must be some oil and frankincense on the grain offering. The priest will take a handful of fine flour from the grain offering and burn it on the altar as a sweet-smelling memorial offering to the LORD. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>“Aaron and his sons will use the rest of that grain to make bread without yeast. This must be eaten in a holy place—in the courtyard around the Meeting Tent.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I have given this part of the grain offering as the priests’ share of the gifts offered to me. Like the sin offering and the guilt offering, it is most holy. It must not be baked with yeast.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Any male descendant of Aaron may eat from these gifts to the LORD. This is their share forever throughout your generations. Whatever touches these offerings will be made holy.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Whatever … holy Or “Whoever touches these offerings will become holy.” This might mean that anyone but the priests must die for touching the sacred food.</span></a>” </div><div class='s'>The Priests’ Grain Offering </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The LORD said to Moses,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>“This is the offering that Aaron and his sons must bring to the LORD when Aaron is anointed to be the high priest. They must bring 8 cups<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> 8 cups Literally, “1/10 of an ephah” (2.2 l).</span></a> of fine flour for a grain offering. This will be offered at the times of the daily offering—half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The fine flour must be mixed with oil and baked on a pan. After it is cooked, you must bring it in, break it into pieces, and offer it as a sweet-smelling gift to LORD. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>“In the future, when Aaron’s descendants take their place as the anointed priests,<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> anointed priests Special oil was poured on the priest’s head to show that God chose him to serve.

The grain offering must be completely burned for the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Every grain offering that a priest gives must be completely burned.
