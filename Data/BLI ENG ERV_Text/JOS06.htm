<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 6</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The gates of the city of Jericho were closed. The people in the city were afraid because the Israelites were near. No one went into the city, and no one came out. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Look, I will let you defeat the city of Jericho. You will defeat the king and all the fighting men in the city.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>March around the city with your army once every day for six days.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Tell seven of the priests to carry trumpets made from the horns of male sheep and to march in front of the priests who are carrying the Holy Box. On the seventh day march around the city seven times and tell the priests to blow the trumpets while they march.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They will make one loud noise from the trumpets. When you hear that noise, tell all the people to begin shouting. When you do this, the walls of the city will fall down and your people will be able to go straight into the city.” </div><div class='s'>The Battle Against Jericho </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So Joshua son of Nun called the priests together and said to them, “Carry the Holy Box of the LORD. Tell seven priests to carry the trumpets and march in front of it.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then Joshua ordered the people, “Now go! March around the city. The soldiers with weapons will march in front of the Holy Box of the LORD.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>After Joshua finished speaking to the people, the seven priests with the trumpets began marching before the LORD, blowing the trumpets as they marched. The priests carrying the LORD’S Holy Box followed them.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The soldiers with weapons marched in front of the priests who were blowing the horns. And the rest of the men walked behind the Holy Box, marching and blowing their trumpets.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Joshua had told the people not to give a war cry. He said, “Don’t shout. Don’t say a word until the day I tell you. Then you will shout.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So Joshua made the priests carry the Holy Box of the LORD around the city one time. Then they went back to the camp and spent the night there. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Early the next morning Joshua got up, and the priests carried the LORD’S Holy Box again.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The seven priests with the trumpets marched in front of the LORD’S Holy Box, blowing their trumpets. The soldiers with weapons marched in front of them. The rest of the people marched behind the LORD’S Holy Box. During the whole time they marched, the priests were blowing the trumpets.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>On the second day, they all marched around the city one time. And then they went back to the camp. They continued to do this every day for six days. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>On the seventh day, they got up at dawn and marched around the city seven times. They marched in the same way they had marched on the days before, but on that day they marched around the city seven times.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The seventh time they marched around the city, the priests blew their trumpets. Then Joshua gave the command: “Now, shout! The LORD is giving you this city!  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The city and everything is to be destroyed as an offering to the LORD. Only Rahab the prostitute and everyone in her house will be left alive. These people must not be killed because she helped the two spies.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Remember, we must destroy everything else. Don’t take anything. If you take anything and bring it into our camp, you yourselves will be destroyed, and you will cause trouble for the rest of our people.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>All the things made from silver, gold, bronze, and iron belong to the LORD. They must be put in the LORD’S treasury.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So then the priests blew the trumpets. When the people heard the trumpets, they began shouting. The walls fell down, and the people ran up into the city. So the Israelites defeated that city.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The people destroyed everything in the city. They destroyed everything that was living there. They killed the young and old men, the young and old women, and the cattle, sheep, and donkeys. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Joshua talked to the two spies. He said, “You made a promise to the prostitute. So go to her house and bring her out and all those who are with her.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So the two men went into the house and brought out Rahab, her father, mother, brothers, all her family, and all those who were with her. They put all the people in a safe place outside the camp of Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then the Israelites burned the whole city and everything in it except for the things made from silver, gold, bronze, and iron. They put these things in the LORD’S treasury.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Joshua saved Rahab the prostitute, her family, and all those who were with her. Joshua let them live because Rahab helped the spies Joshua had sent out to Jericho. Rahab still lives among the Israelites today. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>At that time Joshua made this important promise. He said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Whoever rebuilds Jericho </div><div class='q2'>will be in danger from the LORD. </div><div class='q'>When he lays the foundation, </div><div class='q2'>he will lose his oldest son. </div><div class='q'>When he sets up the gates, </div><div class='q2'>he will lose his youngest son.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> When he … son See 1 Kings 16:34.</span></a> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>So the LORD was with Joshua, and Joshua became famous throughout the whole country. </div><ul class='tnav'>
