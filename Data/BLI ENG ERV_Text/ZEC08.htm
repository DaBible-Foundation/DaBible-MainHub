I love her so much that I became angry when she was not faithful to me.”  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The LORD says, “I have come back to Zion, and I am living in Jerusalem. Jerusalem will be called Faithful City. The mountain of the LORD All-Powerful will be called Holy Mountain.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The LORD All-Powerful says, “Old men and women will again be seen in the public places in Jerusalem. People will live so long that they will need their walking sticks.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the city will be filled with children playing in the streets.”  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The LORD All-Powerful says, “The survivors will think it is wonderful, and so will I!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The LORD All-Powerful says, “Look, I am rescuing my people from countries in the east and west.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I will bring them back here, and they will live in Jerusalem. They will be my people, and I will be their good and faithful God.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The LORD All-Powerful says, “Be strong! You people are hearing the same message today that the prophets gave when the LORD All-Powerful first laid the foundations to rebuild his Temple.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Before that time, people didn’t have the money to hire workers or to rent animals. And it was not safe for people to come and go. There was no relief from all the troubles. I had turned everyone against their neighbor.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But it is not like that now. It will not be like that for the survivors.” This is what the LORD All-Powerful said. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>“These people will plant in peace. Their grapevines will produce grapes. The land will give good crops, and the skies will give rain. I will give all these things to my people.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>People began using the names Israel and Judah in their curses. But I will save Israel and Judah, and their names will become a blessing. So don’t be afraid. Be strong!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The LORD All-Powerful says, “Your ancestors made me angry, so I decided to destroy them. I decided not to change my mind.” This is what the LORD All-Powerful said.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>“But now I have changed my mind. And in the same way I have decided to be good to Jerusalem and to the people of Judah. So don’t be afraid!  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But you must do this: Tell the truth to your neighbors. When you make decisions in your cities, be fair and do what is right. Do what brings peace.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Don’t make secret plans to hurt your neighbors. Don’t make false promises. You must not enjoy doing these things, because I hate them!” This is what the LORD said. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I received this message from the LORD All-Powerful.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The LORD All-Powerful says, “You have special days of sadness and fasting in the fourth month, the fifth month, the seventh month, and the tenth month.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> days … month These were days when the people remembered the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple.
