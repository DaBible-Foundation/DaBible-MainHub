<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 14</div><div class='s'>The Day of Judgment </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Look, the LORD has a special day of judgment coming, when the riches you have taken will be divided in your city.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I will bring all the nations together to fight against Jerusalem. They will capture the city and destroy the houses. The women will be raped, and half of the people will be taken away as prisoners. But the rest of the people will not be taken from the city.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then the LORD will go to war with those nations. It will be a real battle.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>At that time he will stand on the Mount of Olives, the hill east of Jerusalem. The Mount of Olives will split in half. Part of the mountain will move to the north, and part to the south. A deep valley will open up, from the east to the west.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>You will try to run away as that mountain valley comes closer and closer to you. You will run away like the time you ran from the earthquake during the time of King Uzziah of Judah. But the LORD my God will come, and all his holy ones<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> holy ones Here, this probably means angels.</span></a> will be with him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6-7&#160;</span>That will be a very special day. There will not be any light, cold, or frost. Only the LORD knows how, but there will not be any day or night. Then, when darkness usually comes, there will still be light.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>At that time water will flow continually from Jerusalem.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> water … Jerusalem Literally, “living water will flow from Jerusalem.” Jerusalem’s main water supply, the Gihon spring, did not flow continuously.</span></a> That stream will split and part of it will flow east, and part of it will flow west to the Mediterranean Sea. And it will flow all year long, in the summer as well as in the winter.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the LORD will be the King of the whole world. At that time all people will worship him as the only LORD with only one name.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the whole land from Geba in the north to Rimmon in the south past Jerusalem will become a flat plain. The city of Jerusalem will stay in the same place, but it will be built high above the land around it. It will reach from the Benjamin Gate to the First Gate (that is, the Corner Gate) and from the Tower of Hananel to the king’s winepresses.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>People will move to Jerusalem because it will be a safe place to live. It will never again be destroyed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But the LORD will punish the nations that fought against Jerusalem. He will send a terrible disease against them. Their skin will begin to rot while the people are still alive. Their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13-15&#160;</span>That terrible disease will be in the enemy camp, and all their horses, mules, camels, and donkeys will catch that terrible disease. </div><div class='p'>At that time they will be afraid of the LORD. Each man will grab his neighbor’s hand, and they will fight each other. Even Judah will fight against Jerusalem. This will happen even while armies from all the nations are surrounding the city. There will be much gold, silver, and clothing.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Some of the people who came to fight Jerusalem will survive. And every year they will come to worship the king, the LORD All-Powerful. They will come to celebrate the Festival of Shelters.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And if people from any of the families on earth don’t go to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD All-Powerful, no rain will fall on their land.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>If any of the families in Egypt don’t come to celebrate the Festival of Shelters, they will get that terrible disease that the LORD caused the enemy nations to get.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>That will be the punishment for Egypt, and for any other nation that does not come to celebrate the Festival of Shelters. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>At that time even the harnesses on the horses will have the label, <span class='sc'>holy to the lord</span>.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Holy to the LORD These words were written on everything that was used in the Temple. This showed that these things belonged to the Lord, and that they could be used only for special purposes. Dishes with this labels could be used only by the priests in a holy place.</span></a> And all the pots used in the LORD’S Temple will be just as important as the bowls used at the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>In fact, every dish in Jerusalem and Judah will have the label, <span class='sc'>holy to the lord all-powerful</span>. All the people offering sacrifices will come, take those dishes, and cook their special meals in them. </div><div class='p'>At that time there will not be any merchants buying and selling things<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> merchants … selling things Literally, “Canaanites.”</span></a> in the Temple of the LORD All-Powerful. </div><ul class='tnav'>
