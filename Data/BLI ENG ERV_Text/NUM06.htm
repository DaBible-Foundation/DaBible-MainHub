<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 6</div><div class='s'>Nazirites </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The LORD said to Moses,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>“Tell the Israelites this: If there are people, men or women, who want to make a vow dedicating themselves to the LORD as Nazirites for a time, this is what they must do:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>They must stay away from wine or other strong drink. They must not drink vinegar that is made from wine or from other strong drink. They must not drink grape juice or eat grapes or raisins.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>During that special time of dedication, they must not eat anything that comes from grapes. They must not even eat the seeds or the skins from grapes. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“The whole time of their Nazirite vow they must not cut their hair. They must be holy until this time of special dedication to the LORD is ended. They must let their hair grow long. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>“If you have taken the Nazirite vow, you must not go near someone who is dying<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> someone who is dying Or “a dead person.”</span></a> during that special time of dedication. You have given yourself fully to the LORD,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>so you must not let yourself become unclean like this—even for your own father or mother, brother or sister when they die.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> when they die Or “that have died.”</span></a> This is because you have the hair that you dedicated to God on your head!  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>It is holy because you have given yourself fully to the LORD for the full time of that dedication.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So if you are with someone when they suddenly die, you will be unclean and you will have to shave the hair from your head. You must do that on the seventh day of your purification ceremony when you are made clean.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then on the eighth day, you must bring two doves or two young pigeons and give them to the priest at the entrance of the Meeting Tent.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then the priest will offer one bird as a sin offering and the other one as a burnt offering. The burnt offering will be a payment for the sin of touching a dead body during your special time of dedication. Then you must again promise to give the hair on your head as a gift to God.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>This means you must again give yourself to the LORD for another time of dedication. You must bring a one-year-old male lamb to offer as a guilt offering. You must start over from the beginning with a new time of dedication because you touched a dead body during your first time of dedication. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“After their time of dedication is ended, Nazirites must go to the entrance of the Meeting Tent  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and give their offering to the LORD. Their offering must be: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='li'>a one-year-old male lamb that has nothing wrong with it for a burnt offering; </div><div class='li'>a one-year-old female lamb that has nothing wrong with it for a sin offering; </div><div class='li'>one ram that has nothing wrong with it for a fellowship offering; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>a basket of bread made without yeast—bread made with fine flour mixed with oil and wafers with oil spread on top; </div><div class='li'>and the grain offerings and drink offerings that are a part of these gifts. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>“The priest will give these things to the LORD, and then the priest will make the sin offering and the burnt offering.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He will give the basket of bread without yeast to the LORD. Then he will kill the ram as a fellowship offering to the Lord. He will give it to the Lord with the grain offering and the drink offering. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>“The Nazirites must go to the entrance of the Meeting Tent. There they must shave off their hair that they grew as a dedication to the Lord. That hair will be put in the fire that is burning under the sacrifice of the fellowship offering. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>“After the Nazirites have cut off their hair, the priest will give them a boiled shoulder from the ram and a large and a small cake from the basket. Both of these cakes are made without yeast.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then the priest will lift these things up to show that they were presented before the LORD. These things are holy and belong to the priest. Also, the ram’s breast and thigh that were lifted up and presented belong to the priest. After that the Nazirites can drink wine. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>“These are the rules for those who decide to make the Nazirite vow. They must give all these gifts to the LORD. But they might be able to give much more. If they promise to do more, they must keep their promise. But they must give at least all the things listed in these rules for the Nazirite vow.” </div><div class='s'>The Priests’ Blessings </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The LORD said to Moses,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>“Tell Aaron and his sons that when they bless the Israelites, this is what they should say: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>‘May the LORD bless you </div><div class='q2'>and keep you. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>May the LORD smile down on you<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> May … on you Literally, “May the LORD make his face shine on you.”</span></a> </div><div class='q2'>and show you his kindness. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>May the LORD answer your prayers<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> May … prayers Literally, “May the LORD lift his face to you,” that is, “may he accept you into his presence and grant your request.”</span></a> </div><div class='q2'>and give you peace.’ </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>In this way Aaron and his sons will use my name to give a blessing to the Israelites, and I will bless them.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
