He said, “While you heard me reading these words just now, they were coming true!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Everyone there said good things about Jesus. They were amazed to hear him speak such wonderful words. They said, “How is this possible? Isn’t he Joseph’s son?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Jesus said to them, “I know you will tell me the old saying: ‘Doctor, heal yourself.’ You want to say, ‘We heard about the things you did in Capernaum.

The man shouted loudly,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>“Jesus of Nazareth! What do you want with us? Did you come here to destroy us? I know who you are—God’s Holy One!”  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>But Jesus warned the evil spirit to stop. He said, “Be quiet!
