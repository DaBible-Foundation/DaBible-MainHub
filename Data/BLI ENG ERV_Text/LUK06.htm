His followers picked the grain, rubbed it in their hands, and ate it.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Some Pharisees said, “Why are you doing that? It is against the Law of Moses to do that on the Sabbath day.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “You have read about what David did when he and the people with him were hungry.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>David went into God’s house. He took the bread that was offered to God and ate it. And he gave some of the bread to the people with him. This was against the Law of Moses, which says that only the priests can eat that bread.”  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then Jesus said to the Pharisees, “The Son of Man is Lord over the Sabbath day.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Heals a Man on the Sabbath Day </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 12:9–14; Mk. 3:1–6) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>On another Sabbath day Jesus went into the synagogue and taught the people. A man with a crippled right hand was there.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The teachers of the law and the Pharisees were watching Jesus closely. They were waiting to see if he would heal on the Sabbath day. They wanted to see him do something wrong so that they could accuse him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to the man with the crippled hand, “Get up and stand here where everyone can see.” The man got up and stood there.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then Jesus said to them, “I ask you, which is the right thing to do on the Sabbath day: to do good or to do evil? Is it right to save a life or to destroy one?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Jesus looked around at all of them and then said to the man, “Hold out your hand.” The man held out his hand, and it was healed.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The Pharisees and the teachers of the law got so mad they couldn’t think straight. They talked to each other about what they could do to Jesus. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Chooses His Twelve Apostles </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 10:1–4; Mk. 3:13–19) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>A few days later, Jesus went out to a mountain to pray. He stayed there all night praying to God.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The next morning he called his followers. He chose twelve of them and called them apostles. These are the ones he chose: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Simon (Jesus named him Peter), </div><div class='li'>Andrew, brother of Peter, </div><div class='li'>James, </div><div class='li'>John, </div><div class='li'>Philip, </div><div class='li'>Bartholomew, </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Matthew, </div><div class='li'>Thomas, </div><div class='li'>James, the son of Alphaeus, </div><div class='li'>Simon, called the Zealot, </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Judas, the son of James, </div><div class='li'>Judas Iscariot (the one who turned against Jesus). </div><div class='s'>Jesus Teaches and Heals the People </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 4:23–25; 5:1–12) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Jesus and the apostles came down from the mountain. Jesus stood on a flat place. A large crowd of his followers was there. Also, there were many people from all around Judea, Jerusalem, and the seacoast cities of Tyre and Sidon.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They all came to hear Jesus teach and to be healed of their sicknesses. He healed the people who were troubled by evil spirits.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Everyone was trying to touch him, because power was coming out from him. Jesus healed them all. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Jesus looked at his followers and said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Great blessings belong to you who are poor. </div><div class='q2'>God’s kingdom belongs to you. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Great blessings belong to you who are hungry now. </div><div class='q2'>You will be filled. </div><div class='q'>Great blessings belong to you who are crying now. </div><div class='q2'>You will be happy and laughing. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>“People will hate you because you belong to the Son of Man. They will make you leave their group. They will insult you. They will think it is wrong even to say your name. When these things happen, know that great blessings belong to you.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>You can be happy then and jump for joy, because you have a great reward in heaven. The ancestors of those people did the same things to the prophets. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>“But how bad it will be for you rich people, </div><div class='q2'>because you had your easy life. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>How bad it will be for you people who are full now, </div><div class='q2'>because you will be hungry. </div><div class='q'>How bad it will be for you people who are laughing now, </div><div class='q2'>because you will be sad and cry. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>“How bad it is when everyone says nothing but good about you. Just look at the false prophets.

Do good to those who hate you.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Ask God to bless the people who ask for bad things to happen to you. Pray for the people who are mean to you.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>If someone hits you on the side of your face, let them hit the other side too. If someone takes your coat, don’t stop them from taking your shirt too.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Give to everyone who asks you for something. When someone takes something that is yours, don’t ask for it back.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Do for others what you want them to do for you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>“If you love only those who love you, should you get any special praise for doing that? No, even sinners love those who love them!  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>If you do good only to those who do good to you, should you get any special praise for doing that? No, even sinners do that!  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>If you lend things to people, always expecting to get something back, should you get any special praise for that? No, even sinners lend to other sinners so that they can get back the same amount! </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>“I’m telling you to love your enemies and do good to them. Lend to people without expecting to get anything back. If you do this, you will have a great reward. You will be children of the Most High God. Yes, because God is good even to the people who are full of sin and not thankful.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Give love and mercy the same as your Father gives love and mercy. </div><div class='s'>Be Careful About Criticizing Others </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 7:1–5) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>“Don’t judge others, and God will not judge you. Don’t condemn others, and you will not be condemned. Forgive others, and you will be forgiven.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Give to others, and you will receive. You will be given much. It will be poured into your hands—more than you can hold. You will be given so much that it will spill into your lap. The way you give to others is the way God will give to you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Jesus told them this story: “Can a blind man lead another blind man? No. Both of them will fall into a ditch.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Students are not better than their teacher.

And a bad tree does not produce good fruit.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Every tree is known by the kind of fruit it produces. You won’t find figs on thorny weeds. And you can’t pick grapes from thornbushes!  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Good people have good things saved in their hearts. That’s why they say good things. But those who are evil have hearts full of evil, and that’s why they say things that are evil.
