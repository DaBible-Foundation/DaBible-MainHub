He sent them ahead of him into every town and place where he planned to go.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He said to them, “There is such a big harvest of people to bring in. But there are only a few workers to help harvest them. God owns the harvest. Ask him to send more workers to help bring in his harvest. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>“You can go now. But listen! I am sending you, and you will be like sheep among wolves.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Don’t carry any money, a bag, or sandals. Don’t stop to talk with people on the road.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Before you go into a house, say, ‘Peace be with this home.’  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>If the people living there love peace, your blessing of peace will stay with them. But if not, your blessing of peace will come back to you.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Stay in the peace-loving house. Eat and drink what the people there give you. A worker should be given his pay. Don’t leave that house to stay in another house. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“If you go into a town and the people welcome you, eat the food they give you.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Heal the sick people who live there, and tell them, ‘God’s kingdom is now very near you<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> is now very near you Or “is coming to you soon” or “has come to you.”</span></a>!’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>“But if you go into a town and the people don’t welcome you, then go out into the streets of that town and say,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>‘Even the dirt from your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you. But remember that God’s kingdom is coming soon.’  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I tell you, on the judgment day it will be worse for the people of that town than for the people of Sodom. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Warns People Who Refuse to Believe </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 11:20–24) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“It will be bad for you, Chorazin! It will be bad for you, Bethsaida! I did many miracles in you. If those same miracles had happened in Tyre and Sidon, then the people in those cities would have changed their lives and stopped sinning a long time ago. They would have worn sackcloth and sat in ashes to show that they were sorry for their sins.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But on the judgment day it will be worse for you than for Tyre and Sidon.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to heaven? No, you will be thrown down to the place of death! </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>“When anyone listens to you my followers, they are really listening to me. But when anyone refuses to accept you, they are really refusing to accept me. And when anyone refuses to accept me, they are refusing to accept the one who sent me.” </div><div class='s'>Satan Falls </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>When the 72 followers came back from their trip, they were very happy. They said, “Lord, even the demons obeyed us when we used your name!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Jesus said to them, “I saw Satan falling like lightning from the sky.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>He is the enemy, but know that I have given you more power than he has. I have given you power to crush his snakes and scorpions under your feet. Nothing will hurt you.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Yes, even the spirits obey you. And you can be happy, not because you have this power, but because your names are written in heaven.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Prays to the Father </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 11:25–27; 13:16–17) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then the Holy Spirit made Jesus feel very happy. Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth. I am thankful that you have hidden these things from those who are so wise and so smart. But you have shown them to people who are like little children. Yes, Father, you did this because it’s what you really wanted to do. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>“My Father has given me all things. No one knows who the Son is—only the Father knows. And only the Son knows who the Father is. The only people who will know about the Father are those the Son chooses to tell.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then Jesus turned to his followers. They were there alone with him. He said, “It is a great blessing for you to see what you now see!  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>I tell you, many prophets and kings wanted to see what you now see, but they could not. And they wanted to hear what you now hear, but they could not.” </div><div class='s'>A Story About the Good Samaritan </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. He said, “Teacher, what must I do to get eternal life?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Jesus said to him, “What is written in the law? What do you understand from it?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The man answered, “ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your strength, and all your mind.’<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Deut. 6:5.</span></a> Also, ‘Love your neighbor the same as you love yourself.’<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Lev. 19:18.</span></a>” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Jesus said, “Your answer is right. Do this and you will have eternal life.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But the man wanted to show that the way he was living was right. So he said to Jesus, “But who is my neighbor?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>To answer this question, Jesus said, “A man was going down the road from Jerusalem to Jericho. Some robbers surrounded him, tore off his clothes, and beat him. Then they left him lying there on the ground almost dead. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>“It happened that a Jewish priest was going down that road. When he saw the man, he did not stop to help him. He walked away.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Next, a Levite came near. He saw the hurt man, but he went around him. He would not stop to help him either. He just walked away. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>“Then a Samaritan man traveled down that road. He came to the place where the hurt man was lying. He saw the man and felt very sorry for him.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>The Samaritan went to him and poured olive oil and wine<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> olive oil and wine These were used like medicine to soften and clean wounds.</span></a> on his wounds. Then he covered the man’s wounds with cloth. The Samaritan had a donkey. He put the hurt man on his donkey, and he took him to an inn. There he cared for him.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>The next day, the Samaritan took out two silver coins and gave them to the man who worked at the inn. He said, ‘Take care of this hurt man. If you spend more money on him, I will pay it back to you when I come again.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Then Jesus said, “Which one of these three men do you think was really a neighbor to the man who was hurt by the robbers?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>The teacher of the law answered, “The one who helped him.” </div><div class='p'>Jesus said, “Then you go and do the same.” </div><div class='s'>Mary and Martha </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>While Jesus and his followers were traveling, he went into a town, and a woman named Martha let him stay at her house.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>She had a sister named Mary. Mary was sitting at Jesus’ feet and listening to him teach.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>But her sister Martha was busy doing all the work that had to be done. Martha went in and said, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself? Tell her to help me!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>But the Lord answered her, “Martha, Martha, you are getting worried and upset about too many things.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Only one thing is important. Mary has made the right choice, and it will never be taken away from her.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
