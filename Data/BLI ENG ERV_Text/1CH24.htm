<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 24</div><div class='s'>The Groups of the Priests </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>These were the groups of Aaron’s sons: Aaron’s sons were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did. Nadab and Abihu had no sons, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as the priests.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>David separated the tribes of Eleazar and Ithamar into two different groups. He did this so that these groups could do the duties of work they were given to do. David did this with the help of Zadok and Ahimelech. Zadok was a descendant of Eleazar, and Ahimelech was a descendant of Ithamar.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>There were more leaders from Eleazar’s family than from Ithamar’s. There were 16 leaders from Eleazar’s family and there were eight leaders from Ithamar’s family.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Men were chosen from each family. They were chosen by throwing lots. Some of the men were chosen to be in charge of the Holy Place. And other men were chosen to serve as priests. All these men were from the families of Eleazar and Ithamar. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Shemaiah was the secretary.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> secretary A man who wrote down and copied books and letters.</span></a> He was Nethanel’s son. Shemaiah was from the tribe of Levi. Shemaiah wrote the names of those descendants. He wrote their names in front of King David and these leaders: Zadok the priest, Ahimelech, and the leaders from the families of the priests and of the Levites. Ahimelech was Abiathar’s son. Each time they threw the lots a man was chosen, and Shemaiah wrote down that man’s name. So they divided the work among groups of men from the families of Eleazar and Ithamar. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The first was Jehoiarib’s group. </div><div class='li'>The second was Jedaiah’s group. </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The third was Harim’s group. </div><div class='li'>The fourth was Seorim’s group. </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The fifth was Malkijah’s group. </div><div class='li'>The sixth was Mijamin’s group. </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The seventh was Hakkoz’s group. </div><div class='li'>The eighth was Abijah’s group. </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The ninth was Jeshua’s group. </div><div class='li'>The tenth was Shecaniah’s group. </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The eleventh was Eliashib’s group. </div><div class='li'>The twelfth was Jakim’s group. </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The thirteenth was Huppah’s group. </div><div class='li'>The fourteenth was Jeshebeab’s group. </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The fifteenth was Bilgah’s group. </div><div class='li'>The sixteenth was Immer’s group. </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The seventeenth was Hezir’s group. </div><div class='li'>The eighteenth was Happizzez’s group. </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The nineteenth was Pethahiah’s group. </div><div class='li'>The twentieth was Jehezkel’s group. </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The twenty-first was Jakin’s group. </div><div class='li'>The twenty-second was Gamul’s group. </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The twenty-third was Delaiah’s group. </div><div class='li'>The twenty-fourth was Maaziah’s group. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>These were the groups chosen to serve in the LORD’S Temple.
