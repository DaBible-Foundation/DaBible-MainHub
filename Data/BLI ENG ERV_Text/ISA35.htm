The desert will be glad and blossom.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>It will be covered with flowers and dance with joy. It will be as beautiful as the forest of Lebanon, the hill of Carmel, and the Sharon Valley. This will happen because all people will see the Glory of the LORD. They will see the beauty of our God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Make the weak arms strong again. Strengthen the weak knees.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>People are afraid and confused. Say to them, “Be strong! Don’t be afraid!” Look, your God will come and punish your enemies. He will come and give you your reward. He will save you.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then the eyes of the blind will be opened so that they can see, and the ears of the deaf will be opened so that they can hear.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Crippled people will dance like deer, and those who cannot speak now will use their voices to sing happy songs. This will happen when springs of water begin to flow in the dry desert.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Now people see mirages<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> mirages In the desert, heat rising from the ground looks like water from far away.
