One of his followers said to him, “Teacher, look how big those stones are! What beautiful buildings!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Jesus said, “Do you see these great buildings? They will all be destroyed. Every stone will be thrown down to the ground. Not one stone will be left on another.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Later, Jesus was sitting at a place on the Mount of Olives. He was alone with Peter, James, John, and Andrew. They could all see the Temple, and they said to Jesus,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>“Tell us when these things will happen. And what will show us it is time for them to happen?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Jesus said to them, “Be careful! Don’t let anyone fool you.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Many people will come and use my name. They will say, ‘I am the Messiah,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> the Messiah Literally “the one,” meaning the chosen one sent by God. See “Messiah” in the Word List and Mt. 24:5.</span></a>’ and they will fool many people.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>You will hear about wars that are being fought. And you will hear stories about other wars beginning. But don’t be afraid. These things must happen before the end comes.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Nations will fight against other nations. Kingdoms will fight against other kingdoms. There will be times when there is no food for people to eat. And there will be earthquakes in different places. These things are only the beginning of troubles, like the first pains of a woman giving birth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“You must be careful! There are people who will arrest you and take you to be judged for being my followers. They will beat you in their synagogues. You will be forced to stand before kings and governors. You will tell them about me.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Before the end comes, the Good News must be told to all nations.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Even when you are arrested and put on trial, don’t worry about what you will say. Say whatever God tells you at the time. It will not really be you speaking. It will be the Holy Spirit. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>“Brothers will turn against their own brothers and hand them over to be killed. Fathers will hand over their own children to be killed. Children will fight against their own parents and have them killed.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>All people will hate you because you follow me. But those who remain faithful to the end will be saved. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>“You will see ‘the terrible thing that causes destruction.’<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> ‘the terrible thing … destruction’ See Dan. 9:27; 11:31; 12:11.</span></a> You will see this thing standing in the place where it should not be.” (Reader, I trust you understand what this means.) “Everyone in Judea at that time should run away to the mountains.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>They should run away without wasting time to stop for anything. If someone is on the roof of their house, they must not go down to take things out of the house.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>If someone is in the field, they must not go back to get a coat. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>“During that time it will be hard for women who are pregnant or have small babies.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Pray that these things will not happen in winter,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>because those days will be full of trouble. There will be more trouble than has ever happened since the beginning, when God made the world. And nothing that bad will ever happen again.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But the Lord has decided to make that terrible time short. If it were not made short, no one could survive. But the Lord will make that time short to help the special people he has chosen. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>“Someone might say to you at that time, ‘Look, there is the Messiah!’ Or another person might say, ‘There he is!’ But don’t believe them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>False messiahs and false prophets will come and do miracles and wonders,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> miracles and wonders Here, amazing acts done by Satan’s power.</span></a> trying to fool the people God has chosen, if that is possible.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So be careful.
