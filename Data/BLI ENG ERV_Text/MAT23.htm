Do everything they tell you to do. But their lives are not good examples for you to follow. They tell you to do things, but they don’t do those things themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They make strict rules that are hard for people to obey. They try to force others to obey all their rules. But they themselves will not try to follow any of those rules. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“The only reason they do what they do is for other people to see them.

He is in heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And you should not be called ‘Master.’ You have only one Master, the Messiah.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Whoever serves you like a servant is the greatest among you.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>People who think they are better than others will be made humble. But people who humble themselves will be made great. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“It will be bad for you teachers of the law and you Pharisees!

These are the things you should do. And you should also continue to do those other things.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>You guide the people, but you are blind!
