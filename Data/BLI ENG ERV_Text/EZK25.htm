This is what the Lord GOD says: You were happy when my holy place was destroyed. You were against the land of Israel when it was polluted. You were against the family of Judah when the people were carried away as prisoners.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>So I will give you to the people from the east.
