<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 33</div><div class='s'>Jacob Meets Esau </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Jacob looked and saw Esau coming with 400 men. Jacob divided his family into four groups. Leah and her children were in one group, Rachel and Joseph were in one group, and the two maids and their children were in two groups.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Jacob put the maids with their children first. Then he put Leah and her children behind them, and he put Rachel and Joseph in the last place. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Jacob himself went out before them. While he was walking toward his brother Esau, he bowed down to the ground seven times. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>When Esau saw Jacob, he ran to meet him. He put his arms around Jacob, hugged his neck, and kissed him. Then they both cried.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Esau looked up and saw the women and children. He said, “Who are all these people with you?” </div><div class='p'>Jacob answered, “These are the children that God gave me. God has been good to me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then the two maids and the children with them went to Esau. They bowed down before him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then Leah and the children with her went to Esau and bowed down. And then Rachel and Joseph went to him and bowed down. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Esau said, “Who were all those people I saw while I was coming here? And what were all those animals for?” </div><div class='p'>Jacob answered, “These are my gifts to you so that you might accept me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But Esau said, “You don’t have to give me gifts, brother. I have enough for myself.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Jacob said, “No, I beg you! If you really accept me, please accept the gifts I give you. I am very happy to see your face again. It is like seeing the face of God. I am very happy to see that you accept me.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So I beg you to also accept the gifts I give you. God has been very good to me. I have more than I need.” Because Jacob begged Esau to take the gifts, he accepted them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then Esau said, “Now you can continue your journey. I will go with you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But Jacob said to him, “You know that my children are weak. And I must be careful with my flocks and their young animals. If I force them to walk too far in one day, all the animals will die.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So you go on ahead. I will follow you slowly. I will go slowly enough for the cattle and other animals to be safe and so that my children will not get too tired. I will meet you in Seir.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So Esau said, “Then I will leave some of my men to help you.” </div><div class='p'>But Jacob said, “That is very kind of you, but there is no need to do that.”  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So that day Esau started on his trip back to Seir.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But Jacob went to Succoth.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Succoth A town east of the Jordan River. This name means “temporary shelters.”</span></a> There he built a house for himself and small barns for his cattle. That is why the place was named Succoth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Jacob safely ended his trip from Paddan Aram when he came to the town of Shechem in Canaan. He made his camp in a field near the city.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>He bought the field where he camped from the family of Hamor, father of Shechem. He paid 100 pieces of silver for it.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>He built an altar there to honor God. He named the place “El,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> El A Hebrew name for God.</span></a> the God of Israel.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
