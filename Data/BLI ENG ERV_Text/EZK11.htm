<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 11</div><div class='s'>Prophecies Against the Leaders </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then the Spirit<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Spirit Or “wind.”</span></a> carried me to the East Gate of the LORD’S Temple. This gate faces the east, <span class='add'>where the sun comes up</span>. I saw 25 men there at the entrance of this gate. Some of the leaders were among them, including Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then God spoke to me and said, “Son of man,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Son of man This was usually just a way of saying “a person” or “a human being.” Here, it is a way of addressing Ezekiel. Also in verses 4, 15.</span></a> these are the men who make evil plans for this city. They always tell the people to do evil things.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>These men say, ‘We will be building our houses again very soon. We are as safe in this city as meat in a pot!’  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>So you must speak to the people for me. Son of man, prophesy against the people.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then the Spirit of the LORD came on me. He said to me, “Tell them that this is what the LORD said: House of Israel, you are planning big things. But I know what you are thinking.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>You have killed many people in this city. You have filled the streets with dead bodies.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Now, the Lord GOD says this: ‘The dead bodies are the meat, and the city is the pot. But someone will come and take you out of this safe pot.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>You are afraid of the sword, but I am bringing the sword against you!’ ” This is what the Lord GOD said. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He also said, “I will take you out of this city and give you to strangers. I will punish you.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>You will die by the sword. I will punish you here in Israel, so you will know that I am the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Yes, this place will be the cooking pot, and you will be the meat cooking in it. I will punish you here in Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then you will know that I am the LORD. It was my law that you broke. You did not obey my commands. You decided to live like the nations around you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>As soon as I finished speaking for God, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died! I fell to the ground. I bowed with my face touching the ground and said, “Oh, Lord GOD, you are going to completely destroy all the survivors of Israel!” </div><div class='s'>Prophecies Against Survivors in Jerusalem </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But then the word of the LORD came to me. He said,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>“Son of man, remember your brothers, the family of Israel. They were forced to leave their country, but I will bring them back.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> They were … back This is a wordplay. The word meaning “redeemed” sounds like the word meaning “exiled.”</span></a> But now, the people living in Jerusalem are saying, ‘Stay far away from the LORD. This land was given to us—it is ours!’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>“So tell them this: The Lord GOD says, ‘It is true, I forced my people to go far away to other nations. I did scatter them among many countries. But I will be their temple for a short time while they are in those other countries.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But you must tell those people that the Lord GOD will bring them back. I have scattered you among many nations, but I will gather you together and bring you back from those nations. I will give the land of Israel back to you.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>When my people come back, they will destroy all the terrible, filthy idols that are here now.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I will bring them together and make them like one person. I will put a new spirit<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> spirit Or “wind.”</span></a> in them. I will take away that heart of stone, and I will put a real heart in its place.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then they will obey my laws and my commands. They will do the things I tell them. They will be my people, and I will be their God.’ ” </div><div class='s'>The Glory of the Lord Leaves Jerusalem </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then God said, “But now, their hearts belong to those terrible, filthy idols, and I must punish those people for the bad things they have done.” This is what the Lord GOD said.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then the Cherub angels raised their wings and flew into the air. The wheels went with them. The Glory of the God of Israel was above them.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The Glory of the LORD rose into the air and left the city and stopped on the hill east of Jerusalem.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> hill east of Jerusalem This is the Mount of Olives.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then the Spirit<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Spirit Or “wind.”</span></a> lifted me into the air and brought me back to Babylonia. It brought me back to the people who were forced to leave Israel. I saw all this in the vision from God. Then the one I saw in the vision rose into the air and left me.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then I spoke to the people in exile. I told them about everything the LORD showed me. </div><ul class='tnav'>
