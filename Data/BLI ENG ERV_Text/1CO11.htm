<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 11</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Follow my example, just as I follow the example of Christ. </div><div class='s'>Being Under Authority </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I praise you because you remember me in all things. You follow closely the teachings I gave you.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But I want you to understand this: The head of every man is Christ. And the head of a woman is the man.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> the man This could also mean “her husband.”</span></a> And the head of Christ is God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Every man who prophesies or prays with his head covered brings shame to his head.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But every woman who prays or prophesies should have her head covered. If her head is not covered, she brings shame to her head. Then she is the same as a woman who has her head shaved.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>If a woman does not cover her head, it is the same as cutting off all her hair. But it is shameful for a woman to cut off her hair or to shave her head. So she should cover her head. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But a man should not cover his head, because he is made like God and is God’s glory. But woman is man’s glory.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Man did not come from woman. Woman came from man.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And man was not made for woman. Woman was made for man.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So that is why a woman should have her head covered with something that shows she is under authority.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> have her head … authority Literally, “have authority on her head.” This could also be translated, “keep control of her head,” meaning “do what will keep people from misunderstanding her uncovered head.”</span></a> Also, she should do this because of the angels. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But in the Lord the woman needs the man, and the man needs the woman.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>This is true because woman came from man, but also man is born from woman. Really, everything comes from God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Decide this for yourselves: Is it right for a woman to pray to God without something on her head?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Even nature itself teaches you that wearing long hair is shameful for a man.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But wearing long hair is a woman’s honor. Long hair is given to the woman to cover her head.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Some people may still want to argue about this. But we and the churches of God don’t accept what those people are doing. </div><div class='s'>The Lord’s Supper </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>In the things I tell you now I don’t praise you. Your meetings hurt you more than they help you.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>First, I hear that when you meet together as a church you are divided. And this is not hard to believe  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>because of your idea that you must have separate groups to show who the real believers are! </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>When you all come together, it is not really the Lord’s Supper<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Lord’s Supper The special meal Jesus told his followers to eat to remember him. See Lk. 22:14-20.</span></a> you are eating.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I say this because when you eat, each one eats without waiting for the others. Some people don’t get enough to eat or drink, while others have too much.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> have too much Literally, “get drunk.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>You can eat and drink in your own homes. It seems that you think God’s church is not important. You embarrass those who are poor. What can I say? Should I praise you? No, I cannot praise you for this. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The teaching I gave you is the same that I received from the Lord: On the night when the Lord Jesus was handed over to be killed, he took bread  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>and gave thanks for it. Then he divided the bread and said, “This is my body; it is for you. Eat this to remember me.”  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>In the same way, after they ate, Jesus took the cup of wine. He said, “This cup represents the new agreement from God, which begins with my blood sacrifice. When you drink this, do it to remember me.”  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>This means that every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are telling others about the Lord’s death until he comes again. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>So if you eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in a way that does not fit its meaning, you are sinning against the body and the blood of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Before you eat the bread and drink the cup, you should examine your own attitude.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>If you eat and drink without paying attention to those who are the Lord’s body, your eating and drinking will cause you to be judged guilty.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>That is why many in your group are sick and weak, and many have died.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But if we judged ourselves in the right way, then God would not judge us.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But when the Lord judges us, he punishes us to show us the right way. He does this so that we will not be condemned with the world. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>So, my brothers and sisters, when you come together to eat, wait for each other.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>If some are too hungry to wait, they should eat at home. Do this so that your meeting together will not bring God’s judgment on you. I will tell you what to do about the other things when I come. </div><ul class='tnav'>
