</div><hr /><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='s'>The Lord God’s Message Through Hosea </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>This is the LORD’S message that came to Hosea son of Beeri during the time that Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were kings of Judah, and Jeroboam son of Joash was king of Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>This was the LORD’S first message to Hosea. The LORD said, “Go, marry a prostitute who has had children as a result of her prostitution. Do this because the people in this country have acted like prostitutes—they have been unfaithful to the LORD.” </div><div class='s'>The Birth of Jezreel </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So Hosea married Gomer daughter of Diblaim. She became pregnant and gave birth to a son for Hosea.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The LORD said to Hosea, “Name him Jezreel,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Jezreel This name in Hebrew means “God will plant seeds.”</span></a> because soon I will punish the family of Jehu for the people he killed at Jezreel Valley.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> people … at Jezreel Valley See 2 Kings 9-10 for the story of Jehu’s revolt at Jezreel Valley.</span></a> Then I will put an end to the kingdom of the nation<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> nation Literally, “house.” This might mean the royal family of that country. Also in verse 6.</span></a> of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And at that time I will break Israel’s bow at Jezreel Valley.” </div><div class='s'>The Birth of Lo-Ruhamah </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then Gomer became pregnant again and gave birth to a daughter. The LORD said to Hosea, “Name her Lo-Ruhamah,<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Lo-Ruhamah This name in Hebrew means “She receives no mercy.” Also in verse 8.</span></a> because I will not show mercy to the nation of Israel anymore, nor will I forgive them.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But I will show mercy to the nation of Judah. I will save them, but I will not use bows or swords or war horses and soldiers to save them. I will save them by my own power.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> by my own power Literally, “by the LORD their God.”</span></a>” </div><div class='s'>The Birth of Lo-Ammi </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>After Gomer had finished nursing Lo-Ruhamah, she became pregnant again and gave birth to a son.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then the Lord said, “Name him Lo-Ammi,<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Lo-Ammi This name in Hebrew means “not my people.”</span></a> because you are not my people, and I am not your God.” </div><div class='s'>The Lord Speaks to the Nation of Israel </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>“In the future the number of the people of Israel will be like the sand of the sea, which you cannot measure or count. In the same place that God told them, ‘You are not my people,’ he will call them ‘children of the Living God.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>“Then the people of Judah and the people of Israel will be gathered together.
