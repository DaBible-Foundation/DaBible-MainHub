If clouds are full of rain, they will pour water on the earth. If a tree falls—to the south or to the north—then it will stay where it falls. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But there are some things that you cannot be sure of. You must take a chance. If you wait for perfect weather, you will never plant your seeds. If you are afraid that every cloud will bring rain, you will never harvest your crops. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>You don’t know where the wind blows. And you don’t know how a baby grows in its mother’s womb. In the same way, you don’t know what God will do—and he makes everything happen. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So begin planting early in the morning, and don’t stop working until evening.

It is nice to see the light from the sun.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>You should enjoy every day of your life, no matter how long you live. But remember that you will die, and you will be dead much longer than you were alive. And after you are dead, you cannot do anything. </div><div class='s'>Serve God While You Are Young </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So young people, enjoy yourselves while you are young. Be happy. Do whatever your heart leads you to do. Do whatever you want, but remember that God will judge you for everything you do.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Don’t let your anger control you, and don’t let your body lead you to sin.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Don’t let … sin Or “Don’t worry about things.
