He went into a garden there, his followers still with him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Judas, the one responsible for handing Jesus over, knew where this place was. He knew because Jesus often met there with his followers.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So Judas led a group of soldiers to the garden, along with some guards from the leading priests and the Pharisees. They were carrying torches, lanterns, and weapons. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Jesus already knew everything that would happen to him. So he went out and asked them, “Who are you looking for?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They answered, “Jesus from Nazareth.” </div><div class='p'>He said, “I am Jesus.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> “I am Jesus” Literally, “I am,” which could have the same meaning here that it has in 8:24, 28, 58; 13:19.

So if you are looking for me, let these other men go free.”  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>This was to show the truth of what Jesus said earlier: “I have not lost anyone you gave me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Simon Peter had a sword, which he pulled out. He struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear. (The servant’s name was Malchus.)  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Jesus said to Peter, “Put your sword back in its place! I must drink from the cup<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> cup A symbol of suffering. Jesus used the idea of drinking from a cup to mean accepting the suffering he would face in the terrible events that were soon to come.</span></a> the Father has given me.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Is Brought Before Annas </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 26:57–58; Mk. 14:53–54; Lk. 22:54) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then the soldiers with their commander and the Jewish guards arrested Jesus. They tied him  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and brought him to Annas, the father-in-law of Caiaphas. Caiaphas was the high priest that year.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He was also the one who had told the other Jewish leaders that it would be better if one man died for all the people. </div><div class='s'>Peter Lies About Knowing Jesus </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 26:69–70; Mk. 14:66–68; Lk. 22:55–57) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Simon Peter and another one of Jesus’ followers went with Jesus. This follower knew the high priest. So he went with Jesus into the yard of the high priest’s house.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But Peter waited outside near the door. The follower who knew the high priest came back outside and spoke to the gatekeeper. Then he brought Peter inside.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The girl at the gate said to Peter, “Are you also one of the followers of that man?” </div><div class='p'>Peter answered, “No, I am not!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>It was cold, so the servants and guards had built a fire. They were standing around it, warming themselves, and Peter was standing with them. </div><div class='s'>The High Priest Questions Jesus </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 26:59–66; Mk. 14:55–64; Lk. 22:66–71) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The high priest asked Jesus questions about his followers and what he taught them.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “I have always spoken openly to all people. I always taught in the synagogues and in the Temple area. All the Jews come together there. I never said anything in secret.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So why do you question me? Ask the people who heard my teaching. They know what I said.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>When Jesus said this, one of the guards standing there hit him. The guard said, “You should not talk to the high priest like that!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “If I said something wrong, tell everyone here what was wrong. But if what I said is right, then why do you hit me?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So Annas sent Jesus to Caiaphas the high priest. He was still tied. </div><div class='s'>Peter Lies Again </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 26:71–75; Mk. 14:69–72; Lk. 22:58–62) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Simon Peter was standing at the fire, keeping himself warm. The other people said to Peter, “Aren’t you one of the followers of that man?” </div><div class='p'>Peter denied it. He said, “No, I am not.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>One of the servants of the high priest was there. He was a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off. The servant said, “I think I saw you with him in the garden!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But again Peter said, “No, I was not with him!” As soon as he said this, a rooster crowed. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Is Brought Before Pilate </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 27:1–2, 11–31; Mk. 15:1–20; Lk. 23:1–25) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then the guards took Jesus from Caiaphas’ house to the Roman governor’s palace. It was early in the morning. The Jews there would not go inside the palace. They did not want to make themselves unclean,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> unclean Going into a non-Jewish place would ruin the special cleansing the Jews did to make themselves fit for worship. See Jn. 11:55.</span></a> because they wanted to eat the Passover meal.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So Pilate went outside to them and asked, “What do you say this man has done wrong?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>They answered, “He is a bad man. That is why we brought him to you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Pilate said to them, “You take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.” </div><div class='p'>The Jewish leaders answered, “But your law does not allow us to punish anyone by killing them.”  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>(This was to show the truth of what Jesus said about how he would die.) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Then Pilate went back inside the palace. He called for Jesus and asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Jesus said, “Is that your own question, or did other people tell you about me?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Pilate said, “I’m not a Jew! It was your own people and their leading priests who brought you before me. What have you done wrong?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Jesus said, “My kingdom does not belong to this world. If it did, my servants would fight so that I would not be handed over to the Jewish leaders. No, my kingdom is not an earthly one.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Pilate said, “So you are a king.” </div><div class='p'>Jesus answered, “You are right to say that I am a king. I was born for this: to tell people about the truth. That is why I came into the world. And everyone who belongs to the truth listens to me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Pilate said, “What is truth?” Then he went out to the Jewish leaders again and said to them, “I can find nothing against this man.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>But it is one of your customs for me to free one prisoner to you at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to free this ‘king of the Jews’?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>They shouted back, “No, not him! Let Barabbas go free!” (Barabbas was a rebel.) </div><ul class='tnav'>
