He ruled in Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Jeremiah This is not the prophet Jeremiah, but a different man with the same name.</span></a> Hamutal’s family was from the town of Libnah.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Zedekiah did evil things, just as King Jehoiakim had done. The LORD did not like Zedekiah doing those evil things.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Terrible things happened to the people of Jerusalem and Judah because the LORD was angry with them. Finally, he threw them out of his presence. </div><div class='p'>Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>So in the ninth year of Zedekiah’s rule, on the tenth day of the tenth month,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> ninth year … tenth month That is, January of 588 B.C.</span></a> King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army. The army of Babylon set up their camp outside of Jerusalem. Then they built ramps all around the city walls so that they could get over the walls.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The city of Jerusalem was surrounded by the army of Babylon until the eleventh year that Zedekiah<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> the eleventh year … Zedekiah That is, 587 B.C.</span></a> was king.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>By the ninth day of the fourth month of that year, the hunger in the city was very bad. There was no food left for the people in the city to eat.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>On that day the army of Babylon broke into Jerusalem. The soldiers of Jerusalem ran away. They left the city at night. They went through the gate between the two walls. That gate was near the king’s garden. Even though the army of Babylon had surrounded the city, the soldiers of Jerusalem still ran away toward the desert. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But the Babylonian army chased King Zedekiah and caught him on the plains of Jericho. All of Zedekiah’s soldiers ran away.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The army of Babylon captured King Zedekiah and took him to the king of Babylon who was at the city of Riblah, in the land of Hamath. At Riblah the king of Babylon announced his judgment on King Zedekiah.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>There, at the town of Riblah, the king of Babylon killed Zedekiah’s sons while Zedekiah watched. The king of Babylon also killed all the royal officials of Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then the king of Babylon tore out Zedekiah’s eyes. He put bronze chains on him and took him to Babylon. In Babylon he put Zedekiah into prison. He stayed in prison until the day he died. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Nebuzaradan was the commander of the king of Babylon’s special guard. He was one of the king’s most important officials while at Jerusalem.

He took them and the skilled craftsmen who were left in Jerusalem as captives to Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But Nebuzaradan left some of the poorest people behind in the land. He left them to work in the vineyards and the fields. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The Babylonian army broke up the bronze columns of the LORD’S Temple. They also broke up the stands and the bronze tank<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> bronze columns … tank These verses list the things that the Babylonian army took away from the Lord’s Temple.

They carried all that bronze to Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The army of Babylon also took these things from the Temple: pots, shovels, lamp snuffers, large bowls, pans, and all the bronze things that were used in the Temple service.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The commander of the king’s special guards took these things away: basins, firepans, large bowls, pots, lampstands, pans, and bowls used for drink offerings. He took everything that was made of gold or silver.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The two pillars, the Sea and the twelve bronze bulls under it, and the moveable stands were very heavy. King Solomon had made those things for the LORD’S Temple. The bronze that those things were made of was so heavy it could not be weighed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Each of the bronze pillars was 31 feet<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> 31 feet Literally, “18 cubits” (9.33 m).</span></a> tall.

It was decorated with a net design and bronze pomegranates all around it. The other pillar had pomegranates too. It was like the first pillar.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>There were 96 pomegranates on the sides of the pillars. All together, there were 100 pomegranates above the net design that went around the pillars. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The commander of the king’s special guards took Seraiah the high priest and Zephaniah the next highest priest as prisoners. The three doorkeepers were also taken as prisoners.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The commander of the king’s special guards also took the officer in charge of the fighting men. He also took seven of the king’s advisors as prisoners. They were still there in Jerusalem. He also took the scribe who was in charge of putting people in the army. And he took 60 of the ordinary people who were there in the city.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26-27&#160;</span>Nebuzaradan, the commander, took all these officials and brought them to the king of Babylon. The king of Babylon was at the city of Riblah. Riblah is in the country of Hamath.
