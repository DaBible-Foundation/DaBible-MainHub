<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 26</div><div class='s'>The Sad Message About Tyre </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>In the eleventh year of exile,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> eleventh year of exile This was probably the summer of 587 B.C. See 2 Kings 25:3.</span></a> on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me. He said,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>“Son of man,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Son of man This was usually just a way of saying “a person” or “a human being.” Here, it is a way of addressing Ezekiel.</span></a> Tyre said bad things about Jerusalem: ‘Hurray! The city gate protecting the people is destroyed! The city gate is open for me. The city of Jerusalem is ruined, so I can get plenty of valuable things out of it!’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So the Lord GOD says: “I am against you, Tyre! I will bring many nations to fight against you. They will come again and again, like waves on the beach. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>“The enemy soldiers will destroy the walls of Tyre and pull down her towers. I will also scrape the topsoil from her land. I will make Tyre a bare rock.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Tyre will become a place by the sea for spreading fishing nets. I have spoken!” The Lord GOD says, “Tyre will be like the valuable things soldiers take in war.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Her daughters on the mainland will be killed in battle. Then they will know that I am the LORD.” </div><div class='s'>Nebuchadnezzar Will Attack Tyre </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: “I will bring an enemy from the north against Tyre. That enemy is Nebuchadnezzar, the great king of Babylon! He will bring a very large army. There will be horses, chariots, horse soldiers and many other soldiers. They will be from many different nations.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Nebuchadnezzar will kill your daughters on the mainland. He will build towers to attack your city. He will build a dirt road around your city and a dirt road leading up to the walls.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He will bring the logs to break down your walls. He will use picks and break down your towers.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>There will be so many of his horses that the dust from them will cover you. Your walls will shake at the noise of horse soldiers, wagons, and chariots when the king of Babylon enters the city through your city gates. Yes, they will come into your city because its walls will be pulled down.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The king of Babylon will come riding through your city. His horses’ hoofs<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> hoofs The hard part of a horse’s foot.</span></a> will come pounding over your streets. He will kill your people with swords. The strong columns in your city will fall to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Nebuchadnezzar’s men will take away your riches. They will take the things you wanted to sell. They will break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses. They will throw the wood and stones into the sea like garbage.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So I will stop the sound of your happy songs. People will not hear your harps anymore.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I will make you a bare rock. You will be a place by the sea for spreading fishing nets! You will not be rebuilt, because I, the LORD, have spoken!” This is what the Lord GOD said. </div><div class='s'>Other Nations Will Cry for Tyre </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>This is what the Lord GOD says to Tyre: “The countries along the Mediterranean coast will shake at the sound of your fall. That will happen when your people are hurt and killed.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then all the leaders of the countries by the sea will step down from their thrones and show their sadness. They will take off their special robes and their beautiful clothes. Then they will put on their ‘clothes of shaking.’ They will sit on the ground and shake with fear. They will be shocked at how quickly you were destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They will sing this sad song about you: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“ ‘Tyre, you were a famous city.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> you were a famous city This can also mean “People have cried for you.”</span></a> </div><div class='q2'>People came from across the sea to live in you.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> People … you This can also mean “People have lived in you for a long time.”</span></a> </div><div class='q'>You were famous, </div><div class='q2'>but now you are gone! </div><div class='q'>You were strong on the sea, </div><div class='q2'>and so were the people who lived in you. </div><div class='q'>You made all who live on the mainland </div><div class='q2'>afraid of you. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Now, on the day you fall, </div><div class='q2'>the countries along the coast will shake with fear. </div><div class='q'>You started many colonies along the coast. </div><div class='q2'>Now those people will be afraid when you are gone!’ ” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: “Tyre, you will become an old, empty city. No one will live there. I will cause the sea to flow over you. The great sea will cover you.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>I will send you down into that deep hole—to the place of death. You will join those who died long ago. I will send you to the world below, like all the other old, empty cities. You will be with all the others who go down to the grave. No one will live in you then. You will never again be in the land of the living!  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Other people will be afraid about what happened to you. You will be finished. People will look for you, but they will never find you again.” That is what the Lord GOD says. </div><ul class='tnav'>
