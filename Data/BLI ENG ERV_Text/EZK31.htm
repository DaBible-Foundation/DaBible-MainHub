<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 31</div><div class='s'>Assyria Is Like a Cedar Tree </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>On the first day of the third month in the eleventh year of exile, the word of the LORD came to me. He said,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>“Son of man,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Son of man This was usually just a way of saying “a person” or “a human being.” Here, it is a way of addressing Ezekiel.</span></a> say this to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and to his people: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“ ‘You are so great! </div><div class='q2'>Who can I compare you to? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Assyria was a cedar tree in Lebanon with beautiful branches, </div><div class='q2'>with forest shade, and very tall. </div><div class='q2'>Its top was among the clouds! </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The water made the tree grow. </div><div class='q2'>The deep river made the tree tall. </div><div class='q'>Rivers flowed around the place </div><div class='q2'>where the tree was planted. </div><div class='q'>Only small streams flowed from that tree </div><div class='q2'>to all the other trees of the field. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So that tree was taller than all the other trees of the field, </div><div class='q2'>and it grew many branches. </div><div class='q'>There was plenty of water, </div><div class='q2'>so the tree branches spread out. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>All the birds of the sky made their nests </div><div class='q2'>in the branches of that tree, </div><div class='q'>and all the animals of the field gave birth </div><div class='q2'>under the branches of that tree. </div><div class='q'>All the great nations lived </div><div class='q2'>under the shade of that tree. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The tree was very beautiful. </div><div class='q2'>It was so large! </div><div class='q2'>It had such long branches. </div><div class='q2'>Its roots had plenty of water. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Even the cedar trees in God’s garden </div><div class='q2'>were not as big as this tree. </div><div class='q'>Cypress trees did not have as many branches. </div><div class='q2'>Plane trees did not have such branches. </div><div class='q'>No tree in God’s garden </div><div class='q2'>was as beautiful as this tree. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I gave it many branches </div><div class='q2'>and made it beautiful. </div><div class='q'>And all the trees in Eden, God’s garden, </div><div class='q2'>were jealous!’ ” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So this is what the Lord GOD says: “That tree grew tall. Its top reached up to the clouds. It grew so big that it became proud!  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So I let a powerful king have that tree. That ruler punished the tree for the bad things it did. I took that tree out of my garden.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Strangers—the most terrible people in the world—cut it down and scattered its branches on the mountains and in the valleys. Its broken limbs drifted down the rivers flowing through that land. There was no more shadow under that tree, so all the people left.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Now birds live in that fallen tree. Wild animals walk over its fallen branches. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>“Now, none of the trees by that water will be proud. They will not try to reach the clouds. None of the strong trees that drink that water will brag about being tall, because all of them must die. They will all go down into the world below, to Sheol, the place of death. They will join the other people who died and went down into that deep hole.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: “I made the people cry on the day that tree went down to Sheol. I covered him with the deep ocean. I stopped its rivers and all the water stopped flowing. I made Lebanon mourn for it. All the trees of the field became sick with sadness for that big tree.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I made the tree fall—and the nations shook with fear at the sound of the falling tree. I sent the tree down to the place of death to join the other people who had gone down into that deep hole. In the past, all the trees of Eden, the best of Lebanon, drank that water. The trees were comforted in the world below.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Yes, those trees also went down with the big tree to the place of death. They joined the people who were killed in battle. That big tree made the other trees strong. Those trees had lived under the big tree’s shadow among the nations. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>“Egypt, there were many big and powerful trees in Eden. Which of those trees should I compare you to? They all went down into the world below! And you, too, will join those foreigners<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> foreigners Literally, “uncircumcised.” This means people who did not share in the agreement God made with Israel.

You will lie there among the people killed in battle. </div><div class='p'>“Yes, that will happen to Pharaoh and to the crowds of people with him!” This is what the Lord GOD said. </div><ul class='tnav'>
