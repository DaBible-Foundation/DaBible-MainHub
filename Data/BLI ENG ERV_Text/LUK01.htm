</div><hr /><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='s'>Luke Writes About the Life of Jesus </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Most Honorable Theophilus: </div><div class='p'>Many others have tried to give a report of the things that happened among us to complete God’s plan.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>What they have written agrees with what we learned from the people who saw those events from the beginning. They also served God by telling people his message.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I studied it all carefully from the beginning. Then I decided to write it down for you in an organized way.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I did this so that you can be sure that what you have been taught is true. </div><div class='s'>Zechariah and Elizabeth </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>During the time when Herod ruled Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah. He belonged to Abijah’s group.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Abijah’s group Jewish priests were divided into 24 groups. See 1 Chron. 24.</span></a> His wife came from the family of Aaron. Her name was Elizabeth.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Zechariah and Elizabeth were both good people who pleased God. They did everything the Lord commanded, always following his instructions completely.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But they had no children. Elizabeth could not have a baby, and both of them were very old. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Zechariah was serving as a priest before God for his group. It was his group’s time to serve.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The priests always chose one priest to offer the incense, and Zechariah was the one chosen this time. So he went into the Temple of the Lord to offer the incense.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>There was a large crowd outside praying at the time the incense was offered. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then, on the right side of the incense table, an angel of the Lord came and stood before Zechariah.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>When he saw the angel, Zechariah was upset and very afraid.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But the angel said to him, “Zechariah, don’t be afraid. Your prayer has been heard by God. Your wife Elizabeth will give birth to a baby boy, and you will name him John.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>You will be very happy, and many others will share your joy over his birth.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He will be a great man for the Lord. He will never drink wine or beer. Even before he is born, he will be filled with the Holy Spirit. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>“John will help many people of Israel return to the Lord their God.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>John himself will go ahead of the Lord and make people ready for his coming. He will be powerful like Elijah and will have the same spirit. He will make peace between fathers and their children. He will cause people who are not obeying God to change and start thinking the way they should.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Zechariah said to the angel, “How can I know that what you say is true? I am an old man, and my wife is also old.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel, the one who always stands ready before God. He sent me to talk to you and to tell you this good news.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Now, listen! You will not be able to talk until the day when these things happen. You will lose your speech because you did not believe what I told you. But everything I said will really happen.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Outside, the people were still waiting for Zechariah. They were surprised that he was staying so long in the Temple.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then Zechariah came outside, but he could not speak to them. So the people knew that he had seen a vision inside the Temple. He was not able to speak, so he could only make signs to the people.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>When his time of service was finished, he went home. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Later, Zechariah’s wife Elizabeth became pregnant. So she did not go out of her house for five months. She said,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>“Look what the Lord has done for me! He decided to help me. Now people will stop thinking there is something wrong with me.” </div><div class='s'>The Virgin Mary </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26-27&#160;</span>During Elizabeth’s sixth month of pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to a virgin girl who lived in Nazareth, a town in Galilee. She was engaged to marry a man named Joseph from the family of David. Her name was Mary.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The angel came to her and said, “Greetings! The Lord is with you; you are very special to him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But Mary was very confused about what the angel said. She wondered, “What does this mean?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The angel said to her, “Don’t be afraid, Mary, because God is very pleased with you.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Listen! You will become pregnant and have a baby boy. You will name him Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>He will be great. People will call him the Son of the Most High God, and the Lord God will make him king like his ancestor David.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>He will rule over the people of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Mary said to the angel, “How will this happen? I am still a virgin.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>The angel said to Mary, “The Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of the Most High God will cover you. The baby will be holy and will be called the Son of God.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And here’s something else: Your relative Elizabeth is pregnant. She is very old, but she is going to have a son. Everyone thought she could not have a baby, but she has been pregnant now for six months.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>God can do anything!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Mary said, “I am the Lord’s servant. Let this thing you have said happen to me!” Then the angel went away. </div><div class='s'>Mary Visits Zechariah and Elizabeth </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Mary got up and went quickly to a town in the hill country of Judea.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>She went into Zechariah’s house and greeted Elizabeth.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the unborn baby inside her jumped, and she was filled with the Holy Spirit. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>In a loud voice she said to Mary, “God has blessed you more than any other woman. And God has blessed the baby you will have.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>You are the mother of my Lord, and you have come to me! Why has something so good happened to me?  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>When I heard your voice, the baby inside me jumped with joy.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Great blessings are yours because you believed what the Lord said to you! You believed this would happen.” </div><div class='s'>Mary Praises God </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Then Mary said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“I praise the Lord with all my heart. </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>I am very happy because God is my Savior. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>I am not important, </div><div class='q2'>but he has shown his care for me, his lowly servant. </div><div class='q'>From now until the end of time, </div><div class='q2'>people will remember how much God blessed me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Yes, the Powerful One has done great things for me. </div><div class='q2'>His name is very holy. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>He always gives mercy </div><div class='q2'>to those who worship him. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>He reached out his arm and showed his power. </div><div class='q2'>He scattered those who are proud and think great things about themselves. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>He brought down rulers from their thrones </div><div class='q2'>and raised up the humble people. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>He filled the hungry with good things, </div><div class='q2'>but he sent the rich away with nothing. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>God has helped Israel—the people he chose to serve him. </div><div class='q2'>He did not forget his promise to give us his mercy. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>He has done what he promised to our ancestors, </div><div class='q2'>to Abraham and his children forever.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then went home. </div><div class='s'>The Birth of John </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>When it was time for Elizabeth to give birth, she had a boy.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord was very good to her, and they were happy for her. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>When the baby was eight days old, they came to circumcise him. They wanted to name him Zechariah because this was his father’s name.  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>But his mother said, “No, he will be named John.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>The people said to Elizabeth, “But no one in your family has that name.”  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>Then they made signs to his father, “What would you like to name him?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>Zechariah asked for something to write on. Then he wrote, “His name is John.” Everyone was surprised.  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>Then Zechariah could talk again, and he began praising God.  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>And all their neighbors were afraid. In all the hill country of Judea, people continued talking about these things.  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>Everyone who heard about these things wondered about them. They thought, “What will this child be?” They could see that the Lord was with him. </div><div class='s'>Zechariah Praises God </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>Then Zechariah, John’s father, was filled with the Holy Spirit and told the people a message from God: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>“Praise to the Lord God of Israel. </div><div class='q2'>He has come to help his people </div><div class='q2'>and has given them freedom. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>He has given us a powerful Savior </div><div class='q2'>from the family of his servant David. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span>This is what he promised </div><div class='q2'>through his holy prophets long ago. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V71">71&#160;</span>He will save us from our enemies </div><div class='q2'>and from the power of all those who hate us. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V72">72&#160;</span>God said he would show mercy to our fathers, </div><div class='q2'>and he remembered his holy agreement. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V73">73&#160;</span>This was the promise he made to our father Abraham, </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V74">74&#160;</span>a promise to free us from the power of our enemies, </div><div class='q'>so that we could serve him without fear </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V75">75&#160;</span>in a way that is holy and right for as long as we live. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V76">76&#160;</span>“Now you, little boy, will be called a prophet of the Most High God. </div><div class='q2'>You will go first before the Lord to prepare the way for him. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V77">77&#160;</span>You will make his people understand that they will be saved </div><div class='q2'>by having their sins forgiven. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V78">78&#160;</span>“With the loving mercy of our God, </div><div class='q2'>a new day<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> new day Literally, “dawn,” used here as a symbol, probably meaning the Lord’s Messiah.</span></a> from heaven will shine on us. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V79">79&#160;</span>It will bring light to those who live in darkness, in the fear of death. </div><div class='q2'>It will guide us into the way that brings peace.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V80">80&#160;</span>And so the little boy John grew up and became stronger in spirit.
