These rules are for making them clean. </div><div class='p'>“A priest must look at those who had the skin disease.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The priest must go to them outside the camp and look to see if the skin disease is healed.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>If they are healthy, the priest will tell them to do these things: They must bring two clean birds that are still alive, a piece of cedar wood, a piece of red cloth, and a hyssop plant.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then the priest must order one bird to be killed in a clay bowl over running water.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He must take the other bird that is still alive and the piece of cedar wood, the piece of red cloth, and the hyssop plant and dip them in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He must sprinkle the blood seven times on those who had the skin disease. Then he must announce that they are clean. After that the priest must go to an open field and let the living bird go free. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“The people going through this purification ceremony must wash their clothes, shave off all their hair, and wash with water. Then they will be clean. They may then go into the camp, but they must stay outside their tent for seven days.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>On the seventh day, they must shave off all their hair. They must shave their head, their beard, and their eyebrows—yes, all their hair. Then they must wash their clothes and bathe their bodies in water. Then they will be clean. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>“On the eighth day, anyone who had a skin disease must take two male lambs that have nothing wrong with them and a one-year-old female lamb that has nothing wrong with it.

(This must be the same priest who announced that the person is clean.)  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The priest will take one of the lambs and the oil as a guilt offering. He will lift them in front of the LORD to show they were presented to God.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then the priest will kill the male lamb in the holy place where they kill the sin offering and the burnt offering. Like the sin offering, the guilt offering belongs to the priest. It is very holy. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>“The priest will take some of the blood of the guilt offering.

This flour will be used for a grain offering. The poor person must also take 2/3 of a pint of olive oil  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and two doves or two young pigeons. Even poor people can afford these things. One bird will be a sin offering, and the other will be a burnt offering. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>“On the eighth day, that person will bring these things to the priest at the entrance of the Meeting Tent.

Your people will enter that land. At that time I might cause mildew to grow in someone’s house.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>The person who owns that house must come and tell the priest, ‘I see something like mildew in my house.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>“Then the priest must order the people to take everything out of the house before he goes in to look at the mildew. Then the priest will not have to say everything in the house is unclean. After the people have taken everything out of the house, the priest will go in to look at the house.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>He will look at the mildew. If the mildew on the walls of the house has holes that are a green or red color, and if the mildew goes into the wall’s surface,  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>he must go out of the house and lock the house for seven days. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>“On the seventh day the priest must come back and check the house. If the mildew has spread on the walls of the house,  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>then he must order the people to tear out the stones with the mildew on them and throw them away. They must put these stones at a special unclean place outside the city.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Then the priest must have the entire house scraped inside. The people must throw away the plaster that was scraped off the walls. They must put that plaster at a special unclean place outside the city.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Then new stones must be put in the walls, and the walls must be covered with new plaster. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>“Maybe someone took away the old stones and plaster and put in new stones and plaster. And maybe mildew again appears in that house.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Then the priest must come in and check the house. If the infection has spread in the house, it is a disease that spreads quickly to other places. So the house is unclean.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>The house must be torn down. All the stones, plaster, and pieces of wood must be taken to the special unclean place outside the city.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Anyone who goes into that house will be unclean until evening.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Anyone who eats in that house or lies down in there must wash their clothes. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>“After new stones and plaster are put in a house, the priest must check the house. If the mildew has not spread through the house, the priest will announce that the house is clean, because the mildew is gone. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>“Then, to make the house clean, the priest must take two birds, a piece of cedar wood, a piece of red cloth, and a hyssop plant.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>He will kill one bird in a clay bowl over running water.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Then he will take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the piece of red cloth, and the living bird and dip them in the blood of the bird that was killed over running water. Then he will sprinkle that blood on the house seven times.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>In this way he will use these things to make the house clean.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>He will go to an open field outside the city and let the living bird go free. In this way the priest will make the house pure. The house will be clean.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>These are the rules for any infection of leprosy,  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>for mildew on pieces of cloth or in a house.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>These are the rules for swellings, rashes, or bright spots on the skin.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>These rules teach when something is clean and when something is unclean.
