<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 22</div><div class='s'>Paul Speaks to the People </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Paul said, “My brothers and fathers, listen to me! I will make my defense to you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>When the Jews heard Paul speaking Aramaic, they became very quiet. Then Paul said, </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in the country of Cilicia. I grew up in this city. I was a student of Gamaliel,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gamaliel A very important teacher of the Pharisees, a Jewish religious group. See Acts 5:34.</span></a> who carefully taught me everything about the law of our fathers. I was very serious about serving God, the same as all of you here today.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I persecuted the people who followed the Way. Some of them were killed because of me. I arrested men and women and put them in jail. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“The high priest and the whole council of older Jewish leaders can tell you that this is true. One time these leaders gave me some letters. The letters were to the Jewish brothers in the city of Damascus. I was going there to arrest the followers of Jesus and bring them back to Jerusalem for punishment. </div><div class='s'>Paul Tells About His Conversion </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>“But something happened to me on my way to Damascus. It was about noon when I came close to Damascus. Suddenly a bright light from heaven shined all around me.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ The voice said, ‘I am Jesus from Nazareth, the one you are persecuting.’  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The men who were with me did not understand the voice, but they saw the light. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>“I said, ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ The Lord answered, ‘Get up and go into Damascus. There you will be told all that I have planned for you to do.’  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I could not see, because the bright light had made me blind. So the men led me into Damascus. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>“In Damascus a man named Ananias<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Ananias In Acts there are three men with this name. See Acts 5:1 and 23:2 for the other two.</span></a> came to me. He was a man who was devoted to God and obeyed the Law of Moses. All the Jews who lived there respected him.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He came to me and said, ‘Saul, my brother, look up and see again!’ Immediately I was able to see him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>“Ananias told me, ‘The God of our fathers chose you long ago to know his plan. He chose you to see the Righteous One and to hear words from him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>You will be his witness to all people. You will tell them what you have seen and heard.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Now, don’t wait any longer. Get up, be baptized and wash away your sins, trusting in Jesus to save you.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> trusting in Jesus to save you Literally, “calling on his name,” meaning to show faith in Jesus by worshiping him or praying to him for help.</span></a>’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>“Later, I came back to Jerusalem. I was praying in the Temple area, and I saw a vision.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I saw Jesus, and he said to me, ‘Hurry and leave Jerusalem now! The people here will not accept the truth you tell them about me.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>“I said, ‘But, Lord, the people know that I was the one who put the believers in jail and beat them. I went through all the synagogues to find and arrest the people who believe in you.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The people also know that I was there when Stephen, your witness, was killed. I stood there and agreed that they should kill him. I even held the coats of the men who were killing him!’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>“But Jesus said to me, ‘Leave now. I will send you far away to the non-Jewish people.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The people stopped listening when Paul said this last thing. They all shouted, “Get rid of this man! He doesn’t deserve to live.”  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>They kept on shouting, ripping off their clothes and throwing dust into the air.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> ripping … air These actions were signs of very strong anger.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then the commander told the soldiers to take Paul into the army building and beat him. He wanted to make Paul tell why the people were shouting against him like this.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So the soldiers were tying Paul, preparing to beat him. But he said to an army officer there, “Do you have the right to beat a Roman citizen<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Roman citizen Roman law said that Roman citizens must not be beaten before their trial. Also at 23:27.</span></a> who has not been proven guilty?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>When the officer heard this, he went to the commander and told him about it. The officer said, “Do you know what you are doing? This man is a Roman citizen!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The commander came to Paul and said, “Tell me, are you really a Roman citizen?” </div><div class='p'>He answered, “Yes.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The commander said, “I paid a lot of money to become a Roman citizen.” </div><div class='p'>But Paul said, “I was born a citizen.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The men who were preparing to question Paul moved away from him immediately. The commander was afraid because he had already put Paul in chains, and he was a Roman citizen. </div><div class='s'>Paul Speaks to the Jewish Leaders </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The next day the commander decided to learn why the Jews were accusing Paul. So he ordered the leading priests and the whole high council to meet together. He had Paul’s chains taken off and had him brought in to face the council. </div><ul class='tnav'>
