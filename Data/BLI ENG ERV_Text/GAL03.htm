<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='s'>God’s Blessing Comes Through Faith </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>You people in Galatia are so foolish! Why do I say this? Because I told you very clearly about the death of Jesus Christ on the cross. But now it seems as though you have let someone use their magical powers to make you forget.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Tell me this one thing: How did you receive the Spirit? Did you receive the Spirit by following the law? No, you received the Spirit because you heard the message about Jesus and believed it.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>You began your life in Christ with the Spirit. Now do you try to complete it by your own power? That is foolish.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>You have experienced many things. Were all those experiences wasted? I hope they were not wasted!  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Does God give you the Spirit because you follow the law? Does God work miracles among you because you follow the law? No, God gives you his Spirit and works miracles among you because you heard the message about Jesus and believed it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The Scriptures say the same thing about Abraham. “Abraham believed God, and because of this faith he was accepted as one who is right with God.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Gen. 15:6.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So you should know that the true children of Abraham are those who have faith.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The Scriptures told what would happen in the future. These writings said that God would make the non-Jewish people right through their faith. God told this Good News to Abraham before it happened. God said to Abraham, “I will use you to bless all the people on earth.”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Gen. 12:3.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Abraham believed this, and because he believed, he was blessed. All people who believe are blessed the same as Abraham was. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But people who depend on following the law to make them right are under a curse. As the Scriptures say, “They must do everything that is written in the law. If they do not always obey, they are under a curse.”<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Deut. 27:26.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So it is clear that no one can be made right with God by the law. The Scriptures say, “The one who is right with God by faith will live forever.”<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Hab. 2:4.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The law does not depend on faith. No, it says that the only way a person will find life by the law is to obey its commands.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> the only way … commands See Lev. 18:5.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The law says we are under a curse for not always obeying it. But Christ took away that curse. He changed places with us and put himself under that curse. The Scriptures say, “Anyone who is hung on a tree<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> hung on a tree Deut. 21:22-23 says that when a person was killed for doing wrong, his body was hung on a tree to show shame. Paul means the cross of Jesus was like that.</span></a> is under a curse.”<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Deut. 21:23.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Because of what Jesus Christ did, the blessing God promised to Abraham was given to all people. Christ died so that by believing in him we could have the Spirit that God promised. </div><div class='s'>The Law and the Promise </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Brothers and sisters, let me give you an example from everyday life: Think about an agreement that one person makes with another. After that agreement is made official, no one can stop it or add anything to it, and no one can ignore it.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>God made promises to Abraham and his Descendant.<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Descendant Literally, “seed,” which could also mean “family.” In that case, it would refer to the one family of God in Christ.</span></a> The Scripture does not say, “and to your descendants.” That would mean many people. But it says, “and to your Descendant.” That means only one, and that one is Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>This is what I mean: The agreement that God gave to Abraham was made official long before the law came. The law came 430 years later. So the law could not take away the agreement and change God’s promise. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Can following the law give us the blessing God promised? If we could receive it by following the law, then it would not be God’s promise that brings it to us. But God freely gave his blessings to Abraham through the promise God made. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So what was the law for? The law was given to show the wrong things people do. The law would continue until the special Descendant of Abraham came. This is the Descendant mentioned in the promise, which came directly from God. But the law was given through angels, and the angels used Moses as a mediator to give the law to the people.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But when God gave the promise, there was no mediator, because a mediator is not needed when there is only one side, and God is one.<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Literally, “But the mediator is not of one, but God is one.”</span></a> </div><div class='s'>The Purpose of the Law of Moses </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Does this mean that the law works against God’s promises? Of course not. The law was never God’s way of giving new life to people. If it were, then we could be made right with God by following the law.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But this is not possible. The Scriptures put the whole world in prison under the control of sin, so that the only way for people to get what God promised would be through faith in<a href="#FN10" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> faith in Or “the faithfulness of.”</span></a> Jesus Christ. It is given to those who believe in him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Before this faith came, the law held us as prisoners. We had no freedom until God showed us the way of faith that was coming.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>I mean the law was the guardian in charge of us until Christ came. After he came, we could be made right with God through faith.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Now that the way of faith has come, we no longer need the law to be our guardian. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26-27&#160;</span>You were all baptized into Christ, and so you were all clothed with Christ. This shows that you are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Now, in Christ, it doesn’t matter if you are a Jew or a Greek, a slave or free, male or female. You are all the same in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>You belong to Christ, so you are Abraham’s descendants. You get all of God’s blessings because of the promise that God made to Abraham. </div><ul class='tnav'>
