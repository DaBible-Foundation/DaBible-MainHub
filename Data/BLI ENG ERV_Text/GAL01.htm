<div class='mt'>Galatians  
</div><hr /><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Greetings from Paul, an apostle. I was chosen to be an apostle, but not by any group or person here on earth. My authority came from none other than Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Jesus from death.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Greetings also from all those in God’s family who are with me. </div><div class='p'>To the churches in Galatia<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Galatia Probably the area where Paul began churches on his first missionary trip. Read Acts 13 and 14.</span></a>: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I pray that God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will be good to you and give you peace.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Jesus gave himself for our sins to free us from this evil world we live in. This is what God our Father wanted.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The glory belongs to God forever and ever. Amen. </div><div class='s'>There Is Only One Good News Message </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>A short time ago God chose you to follow him. He chose you through his grace that came through Christ. But now I am amazed that you are already turning away and believing something different from the Good News we told you.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>There is no other message that is the Good News, but some people are confusing you. They want to change the Good News about Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>We told you the true Good News message. So anyone who tells you a different message should be condemned—even if it’s one of us or even an angel from heaven!  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I said this before. Now I say it again: You have already accepted the Good News. Anyone who tells you another way to be saved should be condemned! </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Now do you think I am trying to make people accept me? No, God is the one I am trying to please. Am I trying to please people? If I wanted to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ. </div><div class='s'>Paul’s Authority Is From God </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Brothers and sisters, I want you to know that the Good News message I told you was not made up by anyone.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I did not get my message from any other human. The Good News is not something I learned from other people. Jesus Christ himself gave it to me. He showed me the Good News that I should tell people. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>You have heard about my past life in the Jewish religion. I persecuted the church of God very much. I tried to destroy his people.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I was becoming a leader in the Jewish religion. I did better than most other Jews my own age. I tried harder than anyone else to follow the traditions we got from our ancestors. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But God had special plans for me even before I was born. So he chose me through his grace.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>It pleased him to let me see and know his Son so that I could tell the Good News about him to the non-Jewish people. I immediately prepared to do this work without asking for advice or help from anyone.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I did not go to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was. But, without waiting, I went away to Arabia. Later, I went back to the city of Damascus. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Three years later I went to Jerusalem to meet Peter.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Peter Literally, “Cephas,” the Aramaic name for Peter, one of Jesus’ twelve apostles. Both names mean “rock.” Also in 2:9, 11, 14.</span></a> I stayed with him 15 days.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I met no other apostles—only James, the brother of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>God knows there is nothing untrue in any of this.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Later, I went to the areas of Syria and Cilicia. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>No one in any of Christ’s churches in Judea had ever met me before.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>They had only heard this about me: “This man was persecuting us. But now he is telling people about the same faith that he once tried to destroy.”  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>These believers praised God because of me. </div><ul class='tnav'>
