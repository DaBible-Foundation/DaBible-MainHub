Let others do it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>A stone is heavy, and sand is hard to carry, but the irritation caused by a fool is much harder to bear. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Anger is cruel and can destroy like a flood, but jealousy is much worse. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Open criticism is better than hidden love. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>You can trust what your friend says, even when it hurts. But your enemies want to hurt you, even when they act nice. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>When you are full, you will not even eat honey. When you are hungry, even something bitter tastes sweet. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>A man away from home is like a bird away from its nest. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Perfume and incense make you feel good, and so does good advice from a friend. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Don’t forget your own friends or your father’s friends. If you have a problem, go to your neighbor for help. It is better to ask a neighbor who is near than a brother who is far away. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>My son, be wise. This will make me happy. Then I will be able to answer those who criticize me. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Wise people see trouble coming and get out of its way, but fools go straight to the trouble and suffer for it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>When you make a deal with a stranger, get something from him and any other foreigners with him to make sure he will pay you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Don’t wake up your neighbors early in the morning with a shout of “Good morning!” They will treat it like a curse, not a blessing. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>A complaining wife is like water that never stops dripping on a rainy day.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Stopping her is like trying to stop the wind or trying to hold oil in your hand. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>As one piece of iron sharpens another, so friends keep each other sharp. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>People who take care of fig trees are allowed to eat the fruit. In the same way, people who take care of their masters will be rewarded. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Just as you can see your own face reflected in water, so your heart reflects the kind of person you are. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Just as the place of death and destruction is never full, people always want more and more. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>People use fire to purify gold and silver. In the same way, you are tested by the praise people give you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Even if you pound fools to powder like grain in a bowl, you will never force the foolishness out of them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Learn all you can about your sheep. Take care of your goats the best you can.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Neither wealth nor nations last forever.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Cut the hay, and new grass will grow.
