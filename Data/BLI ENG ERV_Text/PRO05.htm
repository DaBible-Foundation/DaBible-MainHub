<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 5</div><div class='s'>The Wisdom of Avoiding Adultery </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Son, listen to this piece of wisdom from me. Pay attention to what I know to be true.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Remember to live wisely, and what you learn will keep your lips from saying the wrong thing.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Now, another man’s wife might be very charming, and the words from her lips so sweet and inviting.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But in the end, she will bring only bitterness and pain. It will be like bitter poison and a sharp sword.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>She is on a path leading to death, and she will lead you straight to the grave.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Don’t follow her. She has lost her way and does not even know it. Be careful. Stay on the road that leads to life. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Now, my sons, listen to me. Don’t forget the words I say.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Stay away from the woman who commits adultery. Don’t even go near her house.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>If you do, others will get the honor you should have had. Some stranger will get everything you worked years to get.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>People you don’t know will take all your wealth. Others will get what you worked for.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>At the end of your life, you will be sad that you ruined your health and lost everything you had.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12-13&#160;</span>Then you will say, “Why didn’t I listen to my parents? Why didn’t I pay attention to my teachers? I didn’t want to be disciplined. I refused to be corrected.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So now I have suffered through just about every kind of trouble anyone can have, and everyone knows it.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Now, about sex and marriage: Drink only the water that comes from your own well,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and don’t let your water flow out into the streets.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Keep it for yourself, and don’t share it with strangers.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Be happy with your own wife. Enjoy the woman you married while you were young.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>She is like a beautiful deer, a lovely fawn. Let her love satisfy you completely. Stay drunk on her love,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and don’t go stumbling into the arms of another woman. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The LORD clearly sees everything you do. He watches where you go.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The sins of the wicked will trap them. Those sins will be like ropes holding them back.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Evil people will die because they refuse to be disciplined. They will be trapped by their own desires. </div><ul class='tnav'>
