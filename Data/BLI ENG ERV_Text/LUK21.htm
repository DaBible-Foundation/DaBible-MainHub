But the truth is, she gave more than all those rich people.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They have plenty, and they gave only what they did not need. This woman is very poor, but she gave all she had to live on.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Warns About the Future </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 24:1–14; Mk. 13:1–13) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Some of the followers were talking about the Temple. They said, “This is a beautiful Temple, built with the best stones. Look at the many good gifts that have been offered to God.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But Jesus said, “The time will come when all that you see here will be destroyed. Every stone of these buildings will be thrown down to the ground. Not one stone will be left on another.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Some followers asked Jesus, “Teacher, when will these things happen? What will show us that it is time for these things to happen?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Jesus said, “Be careful! Don’t be fooled. Many people will come using my name. They will say, ‘I am the Messiah<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> the Messiah Literally “the one,” meaning the chosen one sent by God. See “Messiah” in the Word List and Mt. 24:5.</span></a>’ and ‘The right time has come!’ But don’t follow them.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>When you hear about wars and riots, don’t be afraid. These things must happen first. Then the end will come later.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Jesus said to them, “Nations will fight against other nations. Kingdoms will fight against other kingdoms.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>There will be great earthquakes, sicknesses, and other bad things in many places. In some places there will be no food for the people to eat. Terrible things will happen, and amazing things will come from heaven to warn people. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>“But before all these things happen, people will arrest you and do bad things to you. They will judge you in their synagogues and put you in jail. You will be forced to stand before kings and governors. They will do all these things to you because you follow me.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But this will give you an opportunity to tell about me.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Decide now not to worry about what you will say.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I will give you the wisdom to say things that none of your enemies can answer.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Even your parents, brothers, relatives, and friends will turn against you. They will have some of you killed.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Everyone will hate you because you follow me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But none of these things can really harm you.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>You will save yourselves by continuing strong in your faith through all these things. </div><div class='s'>The Destruction of Jerusalem </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 24:15–21; Mk. 13:14–19) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>“You will see armies all around Jerusalem. Then you will know that the time for its destruction has come.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The people in Judea at that time should run away to the mountains. The people in Jerusalem must leave quickly. If you are near the city, don’t go in!  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The prophets wrote many things about the time when God will punish his people. The time I am talking about is when all these things must happen.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>During that time it will be hard for women who are pregnant or have small babies, because very bad times will come to this land. God will be angry with these people.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Some of the people will be killed by soldiers. Others will be made prisoners and taken to all the different countries. The holy city of Jerusalem will be under the control of foreigners until their time is completed. </div><div class='s'>Don’t Fear </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 24:29–31; Mk. 13:24–27) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>“Amazing things will happen to the sun, moon, and stars. And people all over the earth will be upset and confused by the noise of the sea and its crashing waves.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>They will be afraid and worried about what will happen to the world. Everything in the sky will be changed.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then people will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>When these things begin to happen, stand up tall and don’t be afraid. Know that it is almost time for God to free you!” </div><div class='s'>My Words Will Live Forever </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 24:32–35; Mk. 13:28–31) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then Jesus told this story: “Look at all the trees. The fig tree is a good example.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>When it turns green, you know that summer is very near.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>In the same way, when you see all these things happening, you will know that God’s kingdom is very near. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>“I assure you that all these things will happen while some of the people of this time are still living.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>The whole world, earth and sky, will be destroyed, but my words will last forever. </div><div class='s'>Be Ready All the Time </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>“Be careful not to spend your time having parties and getting drunk or worrying about this life. If you do that, you won’t be able to think straight, and the end might come when you are not ready.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>It will come as a surprise to everyone on earth.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>So be ready all the time. Pray that you will be able to get through all these things that will happen and stand safe before the Son of Man.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>During the day Jesus taught the people in the Temple area. At night he went out of the city and stayed all night on the Mount of Olives.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Every morning all the people got up early to go listen to Jesus at the Temple. </div><ul class='tnav'>
