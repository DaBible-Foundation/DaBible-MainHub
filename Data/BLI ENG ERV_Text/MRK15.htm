They tied him, led him away, and handed him over to Governor Pilate. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Pilate asked Jesus, “Are you the king of the Jews?” </div><div class='p'>Jesus answered, “Yes, that is right.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The leading priests accused Jesus of many things.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>So Pilate asked Jesus another question. He said, “You can see that these people are accusing you of many things. Why don’t you answer?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But Jesus still did not answer, and this really surprised Pilate. </div><div class='s'>Pilate Tries but Fails to Free Jesus </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 27:15–31; Lk. 23:13–25; Jn. 18:39–19:16) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Every year at the Passover time the governor would free one prisoner—whichever one the people wanted.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>There was a man in prison at that time named Barabbas. He and the rebels with him had been put in prison for committing murder during a riot. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The people came to Pilate and asked him to free a prisoner as he always did.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Pilate asked them, “Do you want me to free the king of the Jews?”  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Pilate knew that the leading priests had handed Jesus over to him because they were jealous of him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But the leading priests persuaded the people to ask Pilate to free Barabbas, not Jesus. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Pilate asked the people again, “So what should I do with this man you call the king of the Jews?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The people shouted, “Kill him on a cross!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Pilate asked, “Why? What wrong has he done?” </div><div class='p'>But the people shouted louder and louder, “Kill him on a cross!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Pilate wanted to please the people, so he set Barabbas free for them. And he told the soldiers to beat Jesus with whips. Then he handed him over to the soldiers to be killed on a cross. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Pilate’s soldiers took Jesus into the governor’s palace (called the Praetorium). They called all the other soldiers together.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They put a purple robe on Jesus, made a crown from thorny branches, and put it on his head.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then they began shouting, “Welcome, king of the Jews!”  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They kept on beating his head with a stick and spitting on him. Then they bowed down on their knees and pretended to honor him as a king.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>After they finished making fun of him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him again. Then they led him out of the palace to be killed on a cross. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Is Nailed to a Cross </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 27:32–44; Lk. 23:26–39; Jn. 19:17–19) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>There was a man from Cyrene named Simon walking into the city from the fields. He was the father of Alexander and Rufus. The soldiers forced him to carry Jesus’ cross.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>They led Jesus to the place called Golgotha. (Golgotha means “The Place of the Skull.”)  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>There they gave him some wine mixed with myrrh, but he refused to drink it.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The soldiers nailed Jesus to a cross. Then they divided his clothes among themselves, throwing dice to see who would get what. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>It was nine o’clock in the morning when they nailed Jesus to the cross.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>There was a sign with the charge against him written on it. It said, “<span class='sc'>the king of the jews</span>.”  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>They also nailed two criminals to crosses beside Jesus—one on the right and the other on the left.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Some Greek copies add verse 28: “And this showed the full meaning of the Scripture that says, ‘They put him with criminals.’ ”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>People walked by and said bad things to Jesus. They shook their heads and said, “You said you could destroy the Temple and build it again in three days.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>So save yourself! Come down from that cross!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The leading priests and the teachers of the law were also there. They made fun of Jesus the same as the other people did. They said to each other, “He saved others, but he can’t save himself!  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>If he is really the Messiah, the king of Israel, he should come down from the cross now. When we see this, then we will believe in him.” The criminals on the crosses beside Jesus also said bad things to him. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Dies </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 27:45–56; Lk. 23:44–49; Jn. 19:28–30) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>At noon the whole country became dark.

The tear started at the top and tore all the way to the bottom.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>The army officer who was standing there in front of the cross saw what happened when Jesus died. The officer said, “This man really was the Son of God!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Some women were standing away from the cross, watching.
