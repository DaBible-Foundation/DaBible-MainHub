<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 10</div><div class='s'>Jesus Christ—the Only Sacrifice We Need </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The law gave us only an unclear picture of the good things coming in the future. The law is not a perfect picture of the real things. The law tells people to offer the same sacrifices every year. Those who come to worship God continue to offer those sacrifices. But the law can never make them perfect.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>If the law could make people perfect, those sacrifices would have already stopped. They would already be clean from their sins, and they would not still feel guilty.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But that’s not what happens. Their sacrifices make them remember their sins every year,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>because it is not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So when Christ came into the world he said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“You don’t want sacrifices and offerings, </div><div class='q2'>but you have prepared a body for me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>You are not pleased with the sacrifices of animals killed and burned </div><div class='q2'>or with offerings to take away sins. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then I said, ‘Here I am, God. </div><div class='q2'>It is written about me in the book of the law. </div><div class='q2'>I have come to do what you want.’ ” <span class='rq'>Psalm 40:6-8</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Christ first said, “You don’t want sacrifices and offerings. You are not pleased with animals killed and burned or with sacrifices to take away sin.” (These are all sacrifices that the law commands.)  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then he said, “Here I am, God. I have come to do what you want.” So God ends that first system of sacrifices and starts his new way.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Jesus Christ did the things God wanted him to do. And because of that, we are made holy through the sacrifice of Christ’s body. Christ made that sacrifice one time—enough for all time. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Every day the priests stand and do their religious service. Again and again they offer the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But Christ offered only one sacrifice for sins, and that sacrifice is good for all time. Then he sat down at the right side of God.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And now Christ waits there for his enemies to be put under his power.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> to be put under his power Literally, “to be made a footstool for his feet.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>With one sacrifice Christ made his people perfect forever. They are the ones who are being made holy. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The Holy Spirit also tells us about this. First he says, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>“This is the agreement<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> agreement The new and better agreement that God has given to his people through Jesus. See “agreement” in the Word List.</span></a> I will make </div><div class='q2'>with my people in the future, says the Lord. </div><div class='q'>I will put my laws in their hearts. </div><div class='q2'>I will write my laws in their minds.” <span class='rq'>Jeremiah 31:33</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then he says, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“I will forget their sins </div><div class='q2'>and never again remember the evil they have done.” <span class='rq'>Jeremiah 31:34</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And after everything is forgiven, there is no more need for a sacrifice to pay for sins. </div><div class='s'>Come Near to God </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And so, brothers and sisters, we are completely free to enter the Most Holy Place.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Most Holy Place Literally, “holies” for “holy of holies,” the spiritual place where God lives and is worshiped.</span></a> We can do this without fear because of the blood sacrifice of Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>We enter through a new way that Jesus opened for us. It is a living way that leads through the curtain—Christ’s body.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And we have a great priest who rules the house of God.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Sprinkled with the blood of Christ, our hearts have been made free from a guilty conscience, and our bodies have been washed with pure water. So come near to God with a sincere heart, full of confidence because of our faith in Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>We must hold on to the hope we have, never hesitating to tell people about it. We can trust God to do what he promised. </div><div class='s'>Help Each Other Be Strong </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>We should think about each other to see how we can encourage each other to show love and do good works.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>We must not quit meeting together, as some are doing. No, we need to keep on encouraging each other. This becomes more and more important as you see the Day getting closer. </div><div class='s'>Don’t Turn Away From God’s Son </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>If we decide to continue sinning after we have learned the truth, then there is no other sacrifice that will take away sins.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>If we continue sinning, all that is left for us is a fearful time of waiting for the judgment and the angry fire that will destroy those who live against God.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Whoever refused to obey the Law of Moses was found guilty from the testimony given by two or three witnesses. Such people were not forgiven. They were killed.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So think how much more punishment people deserve who show their hate for the Son of God—people who show they have no respect for the blood sacrifice that began the new agreement and once made them holy or who insult the Spirit of God’s grace.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>We know that God said, “I will punish people for the wrongs they do; I will repay them.”<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Deut. 32:35.</span></a> And he also said, “The Lord will judge his people.”<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Deut. 32:36.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>It is a terrible thing to face punishment from the living God. </div><div class='s'>Keep the Courage and Patience You Had </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Remember the days when you first learned the truth. You had a hard struggle with much suffering, but you continued strong.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Sometimes people said hateful things to you and mistreated you in public. And sometimes you helped others who were being treated that same way.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Yes, you helped them in prison and shared in their suffering. And you were still happy when everything you owned was taken away from you. You continued to be happy, because you knew that you had something much better—something that would continue forever. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>So don’t lose the courage that you had in the past. Your courage will be rewarded richly.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>You must be patient. After you have done what God wants, you will get what he promised you.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>He says, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Very soon now, the one who is coming </div><div class='q2'>will come and will not be late. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>The person who is right with me </div><div class='q2'>will live by trusting in me. </div><div class='q'>But I will not be pleased with the one </div><div class='q2'>who turns back in fear.” <span class='rq'>Habakkuk 2:3-4 (Greek version)</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>But we are not those who turn back and are lost. No, we are the people who have faith and are saved. </div><ul class='tnav'>
