(I saw this vision after King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took Jehoiachin<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Jehoiachin The Hebrew text has “Jeconiah,” another name for King Jehoiachin, who was taken prisoner in the year 597 B.C.</span></a> as a prisoner. Jehoiachin, the son of King Jehoiakim, and all his important officials were taken away from Jerusalem. They were taken to Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar also took away all the carpenters and metalworkers of Judah.)  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>One basket had very good figs in it, the kind that ripen early in the season. But the other basket had rotten figs. They were too rotten to eat. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The LORD said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” </div><div class='p'>I answered, “I see figs. The good figs are very good, and the rotten figs are very rotten. They are too rotten to eat.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then the message from the LORD came to me.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The LORD, the God of Israel, said, “The people of Judah were taken from their country. Their enemy brought them to Babylon. Those people will be like these good figs. I will be kind to them.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I will protect them. I will bring them back to the land of Judah. I will not tear them down—I will build them up. I will not pull them up—I will plant them so that they can grow.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I will make them want to know me. They will know that I am the LORD. They will be my people, and I will be their God. I will do this because the prisoners in Babylon will turn to me with their whole hearts.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But the LORD also says, “I will treat King Zedekiah of Judah like those figs that are too rotten to eat. Zedekiah, his high officials, all those who are left in Jerusalem, and those people of Judah who are living in Egypt will be like those rotten figs.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I will punish them. Their punishment will shock all the people on earth. People will make fun of those people from Judah. People will tell jokes about them and curse them in all the places where I scatter them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I will bring war, famine, and disease against them. I will attack them until they have all been killed. Then they will no longer be on the land that I gave to them and to their ancestors.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
