<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 11</div><div class='s'>Athaliah Kills the King’s Sons in Judah </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Athaliah was Ahaziah’s mother. She saw that her son was dead, so she got up and killed all the king’s family. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Jehosheba was King Joram’s daughter and Ahaziah’s sister. Joash was one of the king’s sons. While the other children were being killed, Jehosheba took Joash and hid him. She put him and his nurse in her bedroom, so Jehosheba and the nurse hid Joash from Athaliah. That way Joash was not killed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then Joash and Jehosheba hid in the LORD’S Temple. Joash hid there for six years. During that time Athaliah ruled over the land of Judah. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>In the seventh year Jehoiada the high priest sent for the captains of the Carites<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Carites Or “Kerethites,” special soldiers hired to serve the king.</span></a> and guards.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> guards Literally, “runners” or “messengers.”</span></a> He brought them together in the LORD’S Temple and made an agreement with them. There in the Temple of the LORD he forced them to make a promise. Then he showed the king’s son to them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then Jehoiada gave them a command. He said, “This is what you must do. One-third of you, from those who go on duty on the Sabbath day, must stand guard at the royal palace.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Another third will be at the Sur Gate, and the other third will be at the gate behind the guard. This way you will stand guard over the palace on all sides.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Your two divisions who go off duty on the Sabbath day will stand guard at the LORD’S Temple and protect King Joash.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>You must stay with him wherever he goes. The whole group must surround the king. Each guard must have his weapon in his hand, and you must kill anyone who comes too close to you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The captains obeyed everything that Jehoiada the priest commanded. Each captain took his men, both those who were going on duty on the Sabbath day and those who were going off duty. All these men went to Jehoiada the priest,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and he gave spears and shields to the captains. These were the spears and shields David put in the LORD’S Temple.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>These guards stood with their weapons in their hands from the right corner of the Temple to the left corner. They stood around the altar and the Temple and around the king when he went to the Temple.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>These men brought out Joash. They put the crown on him and gave him a copy of the agreement.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> a copy of the agreement Literally, “testimony.” This could be a copy of the Law of Moses (see Deut. 17:18) or a special agreement between God and the king (see verse 17 and 1 Sam. 10:25).</span></a> Then they anointed him and made him the new king. They clapped their hands and shouted, “Long live the king!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Queen Athaliah heard the noise from the guards and the people, so she went to them at the LORD’S Temple.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Athaliah saw the king by the column where new kings usually stood. She also saw the leaders and men playing the trumpets for him. She saw that all the people were very happy. She heard the trumpets, and she tore her clothes to show she was upset. Then Athaliah shouted, “Treason! Treason!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Jehoiada the priest gave a command to the captains who were in charge of the soldiers. Jehoiada told them, “Take Athaliah outside of the Temple area. Kill any of her followers, but don’t kill them in the LORD’S Temple.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So the soldiers grabbed Athaliah and killed her as soon as she went through the horse’s entrance to the palace. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then Jehoiada made the agreement between the LORD and the king and the people. This agreement showed that the king and the people belonged to the LORD. Jehoiada also made the agreement between the king and the people. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then all the people went to the temple of Baal. They destroyed the statue of Baal and his altars. They broke them into many pieces. They also killed Baal’s priest, Mattan, in front of the altars. </div><div class='p'>So Jehoiada the priest put men in charge of maintaining the LORD’S Temple.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The priest led all the people. They went from the LORD’S Temple to the king’s palace. The king’s special guards and the captains went with the king, and all the other people followed them. They went to the entrance to the king’s palace. Then King Joash sat on the throne.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>All the people were happy, and the city was peaceful. And Queen Athaliah was killed with a sword near the king’s palace. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Joash was seven years old when he became king. </div><ul class='tnav'>
