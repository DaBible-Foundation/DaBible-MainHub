He must do everything he said he would do. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>“A young woman might still be living in her father’s house. And that young woman might make a special promise to give something to the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>If her father hears about the promise and agrees, the young woman must do what she promised.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But if her father hears about the promise and does not agree, she is free from her promise. She does not have to do what she promised. Her father stopped her, so the LORD will forgive her. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>“A woman might make a special promise to give something to the Lord and then get married.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>If the husband hears about the promise and does not object, the woman must do what she promised.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But if the husband hears about the promise and refuses to let her keep her promise, the wife does not have to do what she promised. Her husband broke the promise—he did not let her do what she said. So the LORD will forgive her. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“A widow or a divorced woman might make a special promise. If she does, she must do exactly what she promised. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>“A married woman might make a promise to give something to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>If her husband hears about the promise and lets her keep her promise, she must do exactly what she promised. She must give everything she promised.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But if her husband hears about the promise and refuses to let her keep the promise, she does not have to do what she promised. It doesn’t matter what she promised to do; if her husband is against it, this ends her duty to do it. And the LORD will forgive her.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>A married woman might promise to give something to the LORD, or she might promise to do without something,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> do without something Literally, “humble her soul.” Usually this means to make the body suffer in some way, such as by not eating food.</span></a> or she might make some other special promise to God. The husband can stop any of these promises, and the husband can let her keep any of these promises.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>How does the husband let his wife keep her promises? If he hears about the promises and does not stop them, the woman must do exactly what she promised.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But if the husband hears about the promises and stops them, he is responsible for breaking her promises.”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> he … her promises Literally, “he carries her guilt.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>These are the commands that the LORD gave to Moses.
