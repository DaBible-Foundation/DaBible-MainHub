<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='s'>Judgment Against Other Nations </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>This is the LORD’S message against the land of Hadrach and against the city of Damascus. The tribes of Israel are not the only people who know about the LORD. Everyone looks to him for help.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> The Hebrew text here is hard to understand.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>This message is also against the city of Hamath near Damascus. And this message is against Tyre and Sidon, even though those people have been so wise and skillful.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Tyre is built like a fort. The people there have collected so much silver that it is like dust, and gold is as common as clay.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But the Lord will take it all. He will destroy her powerful navy and that city will be destroyed by fire! </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The people in Ashkelon will see this and they will be afraid. The people of Gaza will shake with fear, and the people of Ekron will lose all hope when they see this happen. There will be no king left in Gaza. No one will live in Ashkelon anymore.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The people in Ashdod will not even know who their real fathers are. The Lord says, “I will completely destroy the proud Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>They will no longer eat meat with the blood still in it or any other forbidden food. Any Philistine left alive will become a part of my people; they will be just one more tribe in Judah. The people of Ekron will become a part of my people, as the Jebusites did.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I will protect my country. I will not let enemy armies pass through it. I will not let them hurt my people anymore. With my own eyes I have seen how much my people have suffered.” </div><div class='s'>The Future King </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>People of Zion,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> People of Zion Literally, “Daughter Zion,” meaning the city of Jerusalem.
