The land will grow crops and the trees of the field will grow their fruit.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Your threshing will continue until it is time to gather grapes. And your grape gathering will continue until it is time to plant. Then you will have plenty to eat.

They will be afraid of everything. They will run around like a leaf blown by the wind. They will run as if someone is chasing them with a sword. They will fall even when no one is chasing them.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>They will run as if someone is chasing them with a sword.

I will remember my agreement with Isaac. I will remember my agreement with Abraham, and I will remember the land. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>“The land will be empty.

I will listen to them, even if they are in the land of their enemies. I will not completely destroy them. I will not break my agreement with them, because I am the LORD their God.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>For them, I will remember the agreement with their ancestors. I brought their ancestors out of the land of Egypt so that I could become their God. The other nations saw these things.
