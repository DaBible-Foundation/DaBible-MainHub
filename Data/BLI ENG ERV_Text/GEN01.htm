Deep waters covered the earth, and darkness covered the water. God’s Spirit<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> God’s Spirit Or “A wind from God” or “A mighty wind.”</span></a> was moving like a storm over the surface of the water. </div><div class='s'>The First Day—Light </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then God said, “Let there be light!” And light began to shine.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Or “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

Then he separated the light from the darkness.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>God named the light “day,” and he named the darkness “night.” </div><div class='p'>There was evening, and then there was morning.

Some of the water was above it, and some of the water was below it.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>God named that space “sky.” There was evening, and then there was morning. This was the second day. </div><div class='s'>The Third Day—Dry Land and Plants </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered together so that the dry land will appear.” And it happened.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>God named the dry land “earth,” and he named the water that was gathered together “seas.” And God saw that this was good. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then God said, “Let the earth grow grass, plants that make grain, and fruit trees.

Let these plants grow on the earth.” And it happened.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The earth grew grass and plants that made grain. And it grew trees that made fruit with seeds in it.

He made the larger light to rule during the day and the smaller light to rule during the night. He also made the stars.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>God put these lights in the sky to shine on the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He put them in the sky to rule over the day and over the night.

And God saw that this was good. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then God said, “Now let’s make humans<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> humans The Hebrew word means “man,” “people,” or the name “Adam.” It is like the word meaning “earth” or “red clay.”</span></a> who will be like us.<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Now let’s make … like us Or “Now let’s make humans in our image and in our likeness.”</span></a> They will rule over all the fish in the sea and the birds in the air.
