</div><hr /><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>This is the vision of Isaiah son of Amoz. God showed Isaiah what would happen to Judah and Jerusalem. Isaiah saw this during the time when Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were kings of Judah. </div><div class='s'>God’s Case Against Israel </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Heaven and earth, listen! This is what the LORD says: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“I raised my children and helped them grow up, </div><div class='q2'>but they have turned against me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>A bull knows its master, </div><div class='q2'>and a donkey knows where its owner feeds it. </div><div class='q'>But Israel does not know me. </div><div class='q2'>My people do not understand.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Oh, what a sinful nation! Their guilt is like a heavy weight that they must carry. They are evil, destructive children.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> They … children Or “They are destructive children of evil parents.”</span></a> They left the LORD and insulted the Holy One of Israel. They turned away and treated him like a stranger. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>What good will it do to keep punishing you? You will continue to rebel. Your whole head and heart are already sick and aching.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Your whole … aching Or “Every head and heart is already sick and aching.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>From the bottom of your feet to the top of your head, every part of your body has wounds, cuts, and open sores. You have not taken care of them. Your wounds have not been cleaned and bandaged. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Your land is in ruins, and your cities are in flames. Your enemies have taken your land, and foreigners are taking what it produces. It looks like some foreigners destroyed it.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> It looks … destroyed it Or “It looks like the land of the foreigners that was destroyed.” This might refer to civil war in Israel or to some time when God destroyed foreign nations, such as Sodom and Gomorrah.</span></a> </div><div class='s'>Warnings for Jerusalem </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The city of Jerusalem<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> city of Jerusalem Literally, “daughter Zion.” See “Zion” in the Word List.</span></a> is now like an empty shed left in a vineyard. It is like an old straw hut abandoned in a field of cucumbers or like a city surrounded by enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>If the LORD All-Powerful had not allowed a few people to live, we would have been destroyed completely like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. And that almost happened! </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>You officers of Sodom, listen to the LORD’S message. You people of Gomorrah,<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> officers of Sodom … Gomorrah Here, this refers to leaders and people from Judah.</span></a> listen to God’s teaching.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The LORD says, “Why do you continue giving me all these sacrifices? I have had enough of your sacrifices of rams and the fat from well-fed animals. I don’t want the blood of those bulls, sheep, and goats.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>When you people come to meet with me, you trample everything in my yard. Who told you to do this? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“Don’t keep bringing me those worthless sacrifices. I hate the incense you give me. I cannot stand your festivals for the New Moon, the Sabbath, and other special meeting days. I hate the evil you do during those holy times together.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I hate your monthly meetings and councils. They have become like heavy weights to me, and I am tired of carrying them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>“When you raise your arms to pray to me, I will refuse to look at you. You will say more and more prayers, but I will refuse to listen because your hands are covered with blood. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>“Wash yourselves and make yourselves clean. Stop doing the evil things I see you do. Stop doing wrong.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Learn to do good. Treat people fairly. Punish those who hurt others. Speak up for the widows and orphans. Argue their cases for them in court. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>“I, the LORD, am the one speaking to you. Come, let’s discuss this. Even if your sins are as dark as red dye, that stain can be removed and you will be as pure as wool that is as white as snow. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>“If you listen to what I say, you will get the good things from this land.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But if you refuse to listen and rebel against me, your enemies will destroy you.” </div><div class='p'>The LORD himself said this. </div><div class='s'>Unfaithful Jerusalem </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Look at Jerusalem. She was a faithful city. What made her become like a prostitute? In the past, Jerusalem was filled with justice, and goodness should live there now. Instead, there are murderers. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Once you were like pure silver, but now you are like the impurities that people throw away when the silver is purified. You are like good wine that has been weakened with water.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Your rulers are rebels and friends of thieves. They demand bribes and accept money for doing wrong. They take money to cheat people, and they don’t speak up for widows and orphans. They will not even listen to their cries for help. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Because of this, the Lord GOD All-Powerful, the Mighty One of Israel, says, “Look, I will get relief from my enemies. You will not cause me any more trouble.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>People use lye to clean silver. In the same way, I will clean away all your wrongs. I will remove all the impurities from you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>I will bring back the kind of judges you had in the beginning. Your counselors will be like those you had long ago. Then you will be called ‘The Good and Faithful City.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>God is good and does what is right, so he will rescue Zion and the people who come back to him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But all the criminals and sinners will be destroyed. Those who stopped following the LORD will be removed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>In the future, you will be ashamed of the oak trees and special gardens<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> special gardens Gardens where people worshiped false gods.</span></a> you chose to worship,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>because you will be like an oak tree whose leaves are dying. You will be like a garden dying without water.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Powerful people will be like small, dry pieces of wood, and what they did will be like the sparks that start a fire. These people and their works will both burn up, and no one will be able to put out that fire. </div><ul class='tnav'>
