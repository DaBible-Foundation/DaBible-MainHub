So David prayed to the LORD. And the LORD answered, “Saul and his family of murderers<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> family of murderers Literally, “house of blood.”</span></a> are the reason for the famine, because he killed the Gibeonites.”  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>(The Gibeonites were not Israelites. They were a group of Amorites. The Israelites had promised not to hurt them,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> The Israelites … them This happened in Joshua’s time when the Gibeonites tricked the Israelites. Read Josh. 9:3-15.</span></a> but Saul tried to kill the Gibeonites. He did this because of his strong feelings for the people of Israel and Judah.) </div><div class='p'>King David called the Gibeonites together and talked to them.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>David said to the Gibeonites, “What can I do for you? What can I do to take away Israel’s sin, so that you can bless the LORD’S people?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The Gibeonites said to David, “There isn’t enough gold and silver for Saul’s family to pay for what they did. But we don’t have the right to kill anyone else in Israel.” </div><div class='p'>David said, “Well, what can I do for you?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The Gibeonites said to King David, “The person who plotted against us was Saul. He is the one who tried to destroy all our people living in the land of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Give us seven of Saul’s sons. Saul was the LORD’S chosen king,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> chosen king Literally, “anointed one.”</span></a> so we will hang his sons in front of the LORD on Mount Gibeah of Saul.” </div><div class='p'>King David said, “All right, I will give them to you.”  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But the king protected Jonathan’s son, Mephibosheth. Jonathan was Saul’s son, and David had made a promise in the LORD’S name to Jonathan.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> David had made … to Jonathan David and Jonathan promised each other they would not harm each other’s families. Read 1 Sam. 20:12-23, 42.</span></a> So the king did not let them hurt Mephibosheth.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>David gave them Armoni and Mephibosheth.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Mephibosheth This is another man named Mephibosheth, not Jonathan’s son.</span></a> These were the sons of Saul and Rizpah. Saul also had a daughter named Merab who was married to Adriel son of Barzillai, from Meholah. David took the five sons of Merab and Adriel.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>David gave these seven men to the Gibeonites who then brought them to Mount Gibeah and hanged them in front of the LORD. Those seven men died together in the spring, during the first days of the barley harvest. </div><div class='s'>David and Rizpah </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took a mourning cloth and put it on the rock.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> rock This might be the Big Rock at Gibeon (read 2 Sam. 20:8), the rock that the bodies were lying on, or a rock that marked the place where her sons were buried.</span></a> That cloth stayed on the rock from the time the harvest began until the rains came. Rizpah watched the bodies day and night. She protected them from the wild birds during the day and the wild animals at night. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>People told David what Saul’s slave woman Rizpah was doing.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then David took the bones of Saul and Jonathan from the men of Jabesh Gilead. (The men of Jabesh Gilead got these bones after Saul and Jonathan were killed at Gilboa. The Philistines had hanged the bodies of Saul and Jonathan on a wall in Beth Shan.<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Beth Shan Or possibly, “Beth Shean.”</span></a> But the men of Jabesh Gilead went there and stole the bodies from that public area.)  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>David brought the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from Jabesh Gilead and buried them with the bodies of the seven men who were hanged.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>They buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the area of Benjamin, in one of the tunnels in the grave of Saul’s father Kish, as the king commanded. After that God again listened to the prayers of the people in that land. </div><div class='s'>War With the Philistines </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The Philistines started another war with Israel. David and his men went out to fight the Philistines, but David became very tired and weak.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Ishbi-Benob was one of the giants.<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> one of the giants Or “a son of Rapha (Rephaim).” Also in verses 18, 20, 22.</span></a> His spear weighed over 7 pounds.<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> over 7 pounds Literally, “300 shekels of bronze” (3.45 kg).</span></a> He put on new armor and thought he would be able to kill David.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But Abishai son of Zeruiah killed this giant Philistine and saved David’s life. </div><div class='p'>Then David’s men made him promise that he would not go out to battle anymore. They said, “If you do, Israel might lose its brightest leader.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Later, there was another battle with the Philistines at Gob. Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph, another one of the giants. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Later, there was another battle at Gob against the Philistines. Elhanan the son of Jaare Oregim from Bethlehem killed <span class='add'>Lahmi, the brother of</span> Goliath from Gath.<a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Lahmi … Gath See 1 Chron. 20:5.</span></a> His spear was as big as a post.<a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> post Literally, “a weaver’s rod,” the large beam across a loom.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>There was another battle at Gath. There was a very large man who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. He had 24 fingers and toes in all. This man was also one of the giants.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>This man challenged Israel and made fun of them, but Jonathan killed this man. (This was Jonathan, the son of David’s brother Shimei.) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>All four of these men were giants from Gath.
