<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 7</div><div class='s'>The 144,000 People of Israel </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>After this happened I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth. The angels were holding the four winds of the earth. They were stopping the wind from blowing on the land or the sea or on any tree.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then I saw another angel coming from the east. This angel had the seal of the living God. The angel called out in a loud voice to the four angels. These were the four angels that God had given the power to hurt the earth and the sea. The angel said to them,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>“Don’t harm the land or the sea or the trees before we mark the foreheads of those who serve our God.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then I heard how many people had God’s mark on their foreheads. There were 144,000. They were from every tribe of the people of Israel: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>from the tribe of Judah: 12,000 </div><div class='li'>from the tribe of Reuben: 12,000 </div><div class='li'>from the tribe of Gad: 12,000 </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>from the tribe of Asher: 12,000 </div><div class='li'>from the tribe of Naphtali: 12,000 </div><div class='li'>from the tribe of Manasseh: 12,000 </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>from the tribe of Simeon: 12,000 </div><div class='li'>from the tribe of Levi: 12,000 </div><div class='li'>from the tribe of Issachar: 12,000 </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>from the tribe of Zebulun: 12,000 </div><div class='li'>from the tribe of Joseph: 12,000 </div><div class='li'>from the tribe of Benjamin: 12,000 </div><div class='s'>The Great Crowd </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then I looked, and there was a large crowd of people. There were so many people that no one could count them all. They were from every nation, tribe, race of people, and language of the earth. They were standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They all wore white robes and had palm branches in their hands.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They shouted loudly, “Victory belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The elders and the four living beings were there. All the angels were standing around them and the throne. The angels bowed down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They said, “Amen! Praise, glory, wisdom, thanks, honor, power, and strength belong to our God forever and ever. Amen!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then one of the elders asked me, “Who are these people in white robes? Where did they come from?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I answered, “You know who they are, sir.” </div><div class='p'>And the elder said, “These are the ones who have come out of the great suffering.

They worship God day and night in his temple. And the one who sits on the throne will protect them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They will never be hungry again. They will never be thirsty again. The sun will not hurt them. No heat will burn them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The Lamb in front of the throne will be their shepherd. He will lead them to springs of water that give life. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
