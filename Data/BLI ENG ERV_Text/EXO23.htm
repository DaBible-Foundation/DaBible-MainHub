If you are a witness in court, don’t agree to help a bad person tell lies. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>“Don’t do something just because everyone else is doing it. If you see a group of people doing wrong, don’t join them. You must not let them persuade you to do wrong things—you must do what is right and fair. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>“In court, don’t treat a person in a special way simply because that person is poor. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>“If you see a lost bull or donkey, then you must return it to its owner—even if the owner is your enemy. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“If you see an animal that cannot walk because it has too much to carry, you must stop and help that animal.

Don’t make false charges against a person. Never allow innocent people to be killed as punishment for something they did not do. Whoever kills an innocent person is evil, and I will not treat a guilty person as innocent. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“If someone tries to pay you to agree with them when they are wrong, don’t accept that payment. A payment like that can blind judges so that they cannot see the truth.

You should do the same with your vineyards and with your fields of olive trees. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>“Work for six days, but on the seventh day, rest! This will allow your slaves and other workers a time to rest and relax. And your bulls and donkeys will also have a time of rest. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“Be sure that you obey all these laws. Don’t worship false gods. You should not even speak their names! </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>“You will have three special festivals each year. You must come to my special place to worship me during these festivals.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The first festival is the Festival of Unleavened Bread. This is as I commanded you. During this time you will eat bread that is made without yeast. This will continue for seven days. You will do this during the month of Abib, because this is the time when you came out of Egypt. Everyone must bring a sacrifice to me at that time. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>“The second festival will be the Festival of Harvest. This festival will be during the early summer when you begin harvesting the first crops that you planted in your fields. </div><div class='p'>“The third festival will be the Festival of Shelters.
