All these sons came from the marriage of Abraham and Keturah.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5-6&#160;</span>Before Abraham died, he gave some gifts to his sons who were from his slave women. He sent them to the East,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> East This usually means the area between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers as far east as the Persian Gulf.</span></a> away from Isaac.

This cave is in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar. It was east of Mamre.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>This is the same cave that Abraham bought from the Hittites.

Abraham had a son named Isaac.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>When Isaac was 40 years old, he married Rebekah. Rebekah was from Paddan Aram. She was Bethuel’s daughter and the sister of Laban the Aramean.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Isaac’s wife could not have children. So Isaac prayed to the LORD for her. The LORD heard Isaac’s prayer, and he allowed Rebekah to become pregnant. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>While Rebekah was pregnant, the babies inside her struggled with one another.

Esau became a skilled hunter, who loved to be out in the fields. But Jacob was a quiet man, who stayed at home.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Isaac loved Esau. He liked to eat the animals Esau killed. But Rebekah loved Jacob. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>One day Esau came back from hunting. He was tired and weak from hunger. Jacob was boiling a pot of beans.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>So Esau said to Jacob, “I am weak with hunger. Let me have some of that red soup.” (That is why people call him “Red.”<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Red Literally, “Edom,” a name that means “red.”</span></a>) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But Jacob said, “You must sell me your rights as the firstborn son.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Esau said, “I am almost dead with hunger, so what good are these rights to me now?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But Jacob said, “First, promise me that you will give them to me.” So Esau made an oath to him and sold his rights as the firstborn son to Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> lentil A type of bean.</span></a> soup. Esau ate the food, had something to drink, and then left. So Esau showed that he did not care about his rights as the firstborn son. </div><ul class='tnav'>
