<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 24</div><div class='s'>News That Jesus Has Risen From Death </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 28:1–10; Mk. 16:1–8; Jn. 20:1–10) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Very early Sunday morning, the women came to the tomb where Jesus’ body was laid. They brought the sweet-smelling spices they had prepared.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>They saw that the heavy stone that covered the entrance had been rolled away.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>They went in, but they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They did not understand this. While they were wondering about it, two men in shining clothes stood beside them.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The women were very afraid. They bowed down with their faces to the ground. The men said to them, “Why are you looking for a living person here? This is a place for dead people.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Jesus is not here. He has risen from death. Do you remember what he said in Galilee?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He said the Son of Man must be handed over to the control of sinful men, be killed on a cross, and rise from death on the third day.”  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then the women remembered what Jesus had said. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The women left the tomb and went to the eleven apostles and the other followers. They told them everything that happened at the tomb.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>These women were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary, the mother of James, and some others. They told the apostles everything that happened.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But the apostles did not believe what they said. It sounded like nonsense.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But Peter got up and ran to the tomb to see. He looked in, but he saw only the cloth that Jesus’ body had been wrapped in. It was just lying there. Peter went away to be alone, wondering what had happened.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> A few Greek copies do not have this verse.</span></a> </div><div class='s'>On The Road to Emmaus </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 16:12–13) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>That same day two of Jesus’ followers were going to a town named Emmaus. It is about seven miles<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> seven miles Literally, “60 <span class='tl'>stadious</span>,” almost 12 km.</span></a> from Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>They were talking about everything that had happened.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>While they were talking, discussing these things, Jesus himself came near and walked with them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>(But the two men were not allowed to recognize Jesus.)  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He asked them, “What’s this I hear you discussing with each other as you walk?” </div><div class='p'>The two men stopped, their faces looking very sad.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The one named Cleopas said, “You must be the only person in Jerusalem who doesn’t know what has just happened there.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Jesus said, “What are you talking about?” </div><div class='p'>They said, “It’s about Jesus, the one from Nazareth. To God and to all the people he was a great prophet. He said and did many powerful things.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But our leaders and the leading priests handed him over to be judged and killed. They nailed him to a cross.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>We were hoping that he would be the one to free Israel. But then all this happened. </div><div class='p'>“And now something else: It has been three days since he was killed,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>but today some of our women told us an amazing thing. Early this morning they went to the tomb where the body of Jesus was laid.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But they did not find his body there. They came and told us they had seen some angels in a vision. The angels told them Jesus was alive!  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So some of our group went to the tomb too. It was just as the women said. They saw the tomb, but they did not see Jesus.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then Jesus said to the two men, “You are foolish and slow to realize what is true. You should believe everything the prophets said.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The prophets said the Messiah must suffer these things before he begins his time of glory.”  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then he began to explain everything that had been written about himself in the Scriptures. He started with the books of Moses and then he talked about what the prophets had said about him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>They came near the town of Emmaus, and Jesus acted as if he did not plan to stop there.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But they wanted him to stay. They begged him, “Stay with us. It’s almost night. There’s hardly any daylight left.” So he went in to stay with them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Joining them at the supper table, Jesus took some bread and gave thanks. Then he broke some off and gave it to them.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Just then the men were allowed to recognize him. But when they saw who he was, he disappeared.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>They said to each other, “When he talked to us on the road, it felt like a fire burning in us. How exciting it was when he explained to us the true meaning of the Scriptures!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>So the two men got up then and went back to Jerusalem. There they found the followers of Jesus meeting together. The eleven apostles and the people with them  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>said, “The Lord really has risen from death! He appeared to Simon.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Then the two men told what had happened on the road. They talked about how they recognized Jesus when he shared the bread with them. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Appears to His Followers </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 28:16–20; Mk. 16:14–18; Jn. 20:19–23; Acts 1:6–8) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>While the two men were saying these things to the other followers, Jesus himself came and stood among them. He said to them, “Peace be with you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>This surprised the followers. They were afraid. They thought they were seeing a ghost.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But Jesus said, “Why are you troubled? Why do you doubt what you see?  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Look at my hands and my feet. It’s really me. Touch me. You can see that I have a living body; a ghost does not have a body like this.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>After Jesus told them this, he showed them his hands and his feet.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>The followers were amazed and very, very happy to see that Jesus was alive. They still could not believe what they saw. He said to them, “Do you have any food here?”  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>They gave him a piece of cooked fish.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>While the followers watched, he took the fish and ate it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Jesus said to them, “Remember when I was with you before? I said that everything written about me must happen—everything written in the Law of Moses, the books of the prophets, and the Psalms.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Then Jesus helped the followers understand these Scriptures about him.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Jesus said to them, “It is written that the Messiah would be killed and rise from death on the third day.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47-48&#160;</span>You saw these things happen—you are witnesses. You must go and tell people that they must change and turn to God, which will bring them his forgiveness. You must start from Jerusalem and tell this message in my name to the people of all nations.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Remember that I will send you the one my Father promised. Stay in the city until you are given that power from heaven.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Goes Back to Heaven </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 16:19–20; Acts 1:9–11) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Jesus led his followers out of Jerusalem almost to Bethany. He raised his hands and blessed his followers.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>While he was blessing them, he was separated from them and carried into heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>They worshiped him and went back to Jerusalem very happy.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>They stayed at the Temple all the time, praising God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
