You say that the Lord’s altar is unclean. And you don’t like the food from that altar.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>You smell the food and refuse to eat it. You say it is bad. Then you bring sick, crippled, and hurt animals to me. You try to give sick animals to me as sacrifices, but I will not accept them.” This is what the LORD All-Powerful said.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>“Some people have good, male animals that they could give as sacrifices, but don’t. Some people bring good animals and promise to give those healthy animals to me. But then they secretly exchange those good animals and give me sick animals instead. Bad things will happen to those people. I am the Great King and people all around the world respect me!” This is what the LORD All-Powerful said. </div><ul class='tnav'>
