It was great and amazing. There were seven angels bringing seven plagues. These are the last plagues, because after these, God’s anger is finished. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire. All those who had won the victory over the beast and his idol and over the number of its name were standing by the sea. These people had harps that God had given them.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>They sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Great and wonderful are the things you do, </div><div class='q2'>Lord God All-Powerful. </div><div class='q'>Right and true are your ways, </div><div class='q2'>Ruler of the nations. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>All people will fear you, O Lord. </div><div class='q2'>All people will praise your name. </div><div class='q2'>Only you are holy. </div><div class='q'>All people will come and worship before you, </div><div class='q2'>because it is clear that you do what is right.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>After this I saw the temple, the holy place of God’s presence,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> holy place of God’s presence Literally, “tent of the testimony.” See “Holy Tent” in the Word List. Read Ex. 25:8-22.</span></a> in heaven. It was opened,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and the seven angels bringing the seven plagues came out. They were dressed in clean, shining linen cloth. They wore golden bands tied around their chests.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then one of the four living beings gave seven golden bowls to the seven angels. The bowls were filled with the anger of God, who lives forever and ever.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The temple was filled with smoke from the glory and the power of God. No one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished. </div><ul class='tnav'>
