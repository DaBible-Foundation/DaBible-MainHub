<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 19</div><div class='s'>Elijah at Mount Horeb (Sinai) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>King Ahab told Jezebel everything that Elijah did and how Elijah had killed all the prophets of Baal with a sword.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah and said, “I swear that by this time tomorrow, you will be just as dead as those prophets. If I don’t succeed, may the gods do the same or worse to me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>When Elijah heard this, he was afraid. So he ran away to save his life. He took his servant with him, and they went to Beersheba in Judah. Then Elijah left his servant in Beersheba  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>and walked for a whole day into the desert. Then he sat down under a bush and asked to die. He said, “I have had enough, LORD! Take my life. I am no better than my ancestors.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then Elijah lay down under the bush and went to sleep. An angel came to him and touched him. The angel said, “Get up and eat!”  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Elijah looked around, and by his head there was a cake that had been baked over coals and a jar of water. He ate and drank and then went back to sleep. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Later the LORD’S angel came to him again, touched him, and said, “Get up and eat! If you don’t, you will not be strong enough to make the long trip.”  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So Elijah got up. He ate and drank and felt strong. Then Elijah walked for 40 days and nights to Mount Horeb, the mountain of God.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>There Elijah went into a cave and spent the night. </div><div class='p'>Then the LORD said to him, “Elijah, why are you here?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Elijah answered, “LORD God All-Powerful, I have always served you the best I can, but the Israelites have broken their agreement with you. They destroyed your altars and killed your prophets. I am the only prophet left alive, and now they are trying to kill me!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then the LORD said to Elijah, “Go, stand in front of me on the mountain. I, the LORD, will pass by you.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Go, stand … you This is like the time God appeared to Moses. See Ex. 33:12-23.</span></a> Then a very strong wind blew. The wind caused the mountains to break apart. It broke large rocks in front of the LORD. But that wind was not the LORD. After that wind, there was an earthquake. But that earthquake was not the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>After the earthquake, there was a fire. But that fire was not the LORD. After the fire, there was a quiet, gentle voice.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> voice Or “sound.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>When Elijah heard the voice, he used his coat to cover his face and went to the entrance to the cave and stood there. Then a voice said to him, “Elijah, why are you here?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Elijah said, “LORD God All-Powerful, I have always served you the best that I can, but the Israelites broke their agreement with you. They destroyed your altars and killed your prophets. I am the only prophet left alive, and now they are trying to kill me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The LORD said, “Go back. Take the road that leads to the desert around Damascus. Go into Damascus and anoint Hazael as king over Aram.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then anoint Jehu son of Nimshi as king over Israel. Next, anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah. He will be the prophet who takes your place.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Jehu will kill anyone who escapes Hazael’s sword, and Elisha will kill anyone who escapes from Jehu’s sword.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I still have 7000 people in Israel who have never bowed down to Baal or kissed that idol.” </div><div class='s'>Elisha Becomes a Prophet </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So Elijah left that place and went to find Elisha son of Shaphat. Elisha was plowing 12 acres of land and was working on the last acre when Elijah came.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Elisha was plowing … came Or “Elijah was plowing. There were 11 pair of oxen before him, and he was on the twelfth.”</span></a> Elijah went to Elisha and put his coat<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> coat A special robe that prophets wore. Elijah put his coat on Elisha to show that Elisha would take his place as a prophet.</span></a> on Elisha.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Elisha immediately left his oxen and ran after Elijah. Elisha said, “Let me kiss my mother and father goodbye. Then I will follow you.” </div><div class='p'>Elijah answered, “You can do that. I will not stop you.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> I will not stop you Literally, “What have I done to you?” or “What will I do to you?”</span></a>” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Elisha turned away from him and went back. He killed the oxen and used the yoke for firewood. He boiled the meat, gave it to the people, and they all ate together. Then Elisha went to follow Elijah and became his helper. </div><ul class='tnav'>
