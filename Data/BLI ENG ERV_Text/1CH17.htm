God is with you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But that night the word of God came to Nathan.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>God said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='pi'>“Go and tell this to my servant David: The LORD says, ‘David, you are not the one to build a house for me to live in.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5-6&#160;</span>Since the time I brought Israel out of Egypt until now, I have not lived in a house. I have moved around in a tent. I chose people to be special leaders for the Israelites. They were like shepherds for my people. While I was going around in Israel to different places, I never said to any of them: Why haven’t you built a house of cedar wood for me?’ </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>“Now, tell this to my servant David: The LORD All-Powerful says, ‘I took you from the fields and from taking care of the sheep. I made you king of my people Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I have been with you everywhere you went. I went ahead of you and I killed your enemies. Now I will make you one of the most famous men on earth.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I am giving this place to my people Israel. They will plant their trees, and they will sit in peace under those trees. They will not be bothered anymore. Evil people will not hurt them as they did at first.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Those bad things happened, but I chose leaders to care for my people Israel. And I will also defeat all your enemies. </div><div class='pi'>“ ‘I tell you that the LORD will build a house for you.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> build a house for you This does not mean a real house. It means the Lord would make men from David’s family kings for many years.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>When you die, and you join your ancestors, then I will let your own son be the new king. The new king will be one of your sons, and I will make his kingdom strong.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Your son will build a house for me. I will make your son’s family rule forever.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I will be his father, and he will be my son. Saul was the king before you, and I took away my support from Saul. But I will never stop loving your son.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I will put him in charge of my house and kingdom forever. His rule will continue forever!’ ” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Nathan told David about the vision and everything God had said. </div><div class='s'>David’s Prayer </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then King David went to the Holy Tent and sat before the LORD.

And I don’t understand why.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Besides all these things, God, you let me know what will happen to my family in the future. LORD God, you have treated me like a very important man.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>What more can I say? You have done so much for me. And I am only your servant. You know that.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>LORD, you have done this wonderful thing for me and because you wanted to.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>There is no one like you, LORD. There is no God except you. We have never heard of any god doing wonderful things like those!  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Is there any other nation like Israel? No, Israel is the only nation on earth that you have done these wonderful things for. You took us out of Egypt and you made us free. You made yourself famous. You went in front of your people, and forced other people to leave their land for us.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>You took Israel to be your people forever, and you, LORD, became their God! </div><div class='pi'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>“LORD, you made this promise to me and my family.
