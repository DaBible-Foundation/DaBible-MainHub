<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 16</div><div class='s'>Samson Goes to the City of Gaza </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>One day Samson went to the city of Gaza. He saw a prostitute there and went in to stay the night with her.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Someone told the people of Gaza, “Samson has come here.” They wanted to kill him, so they surrounded the city. They hid near the city gate and waited all night for him. They were very quiet all night long. They had said to each other, “When morning comes, we will kill Samson.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But Samson only stayed with the prostitute until midnight. Then he got up and grabbed the doors of the city gate and pulled them loose from the wall. He pulled down the doors, the two posts, and the bars that lock the doors shut. He put them on his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill near the city of Hebron. </div><div class='s'>Samson and Delilah </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Later, Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah, who was from Sorek Valley. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The rulers of the Philistines went to Delilah and said, “We want to know what makes Samson so strong. Try to trick him into telling you his secret. Then we will know how to capture him and tie him up. Then we will be able to control him. If you do this, each one of us will give you 28 pounds<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> 28 pounds Literally, “1100 <span class='add'>shekels</span>” (12.6 kg).</span></a> of silver.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So Delilah said to Samson, “Tell me why you are so strong. How could someone tie you up and make you helpless?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Samson answered, “Someone would have to tie me up with seven fresh, new bowstrings.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> fresh, new bowstrings Bowstrings were often made from sinew (tendons) which is brittle after it becomes old and dry.</span></a> If someone did that, I would be as weak as any other man.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then the rulers of the Philistines brought seven fresh, new bowstrings to Delilah, and she tied Samson with the bowstrings.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Some men were hiding in the next room. Delilah said to Samson, “Samson, the Philistine men are going to capture you!” But Samson easily broke the bowstrings. They snapped like a string when it comes too close to a flame. So the Philistines did not find out the secret of Samson’s strength. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Delilah said to Samson, “You lied to me. You made me look foolish. Please tell me the truth. How could someone tie you up?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Samson said, “Someone would have to tie me up with new ropes. They would have to tie me with ropes that have not been used before. If someone did that, I would become as weak as any other man.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So Delilah took some new ropes and tied up Samson. Some men were hiding in the next room. Then Delilah called out to him, “Samson, the Philistine men are going to capture you!” But he broke the ropes easily as if they were threads. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then Delilah said to Samson, “You lied to me again. You made me look foolish. Now, tell me how someone could tie you up.” </div><div class='p'>Samson said, “If you use the loom to weave the seven braids of hair on my head and tighten it with a pin, I will become as weak as any other man.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Later, Samson went to sleep, so Delilah used the loom to weave the seven braids of hair on his head.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> so Delilah … head This is found in the ancient Greek version but not in the standard Hebrew text.</span></a> Then Delilah fastened the loom to the ground with a tent peg. Again she called out to him, “Samson, the Philistine men are going to capture you!” Samson pulled up the tent peg, the loom, and the shuttle.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> shuttle The tool used to pull the threads back and forth on a loom to make cloth.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then Delilah said to Samson, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when you don’t even trust me? You refuse to tell me your secret. This is the third time you made me look foolish. You haven’t told me the secret of your great strength.”  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>She kept bothering Samson day after day. He got so tired of her asking him about his secret that he felt like he was going to die.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Finally, Samson told Delilah everything. He said, “I have never had my hair cut. I was dedicated to God before I was born. If someone shaved my head, I would lose my strength. I would become as weak as any other man.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Delilah saw that Samson had told her his secret. She sent a message to the rulers of the Philistines. She said, “Come back again. Samson has told me everything.” So the rulers of the Philistines came back and brought the money that they had promised to give her. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Delilah got Samson to go to sleep with his head lying in her lap. Then she called in a man to shave off the seven braids of Samson’s hair. In this way she made Samson weak, and his strength left him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then Delilah called out to him, “Samson, the Philistine men are going to capture you!” He woke up and thought, “I will escape as I did before and free myself.” But Samson did not know that the LORD had left him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The Philistine men captured Samson. They tore out his eyes and took him down to the city of Gaza. Then they put chains on him to keep him from running away. They put him in prison and made him work grinding grain.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But his hair began to grow again. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The Philistine rulers came together to celebrate. They were going to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon. They said, “Our god helped us defeat Samson our enemy.”  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>When the Philistines saw Samson, they praised their god. They said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“This man destroyed our people! </div><div class='q2'>He killed many of our people! </div><div class='q'>But our god helped us </div><div class='q2'>take our enemy!” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The people were having a good time at the celebration. So they said, “Bring Samson out. We want to make fun of him.” So they brought Samson from the prison and made fun of him. They made him stand between the columns in the temple of the god Dagon.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>A servant was holding his hand. Samson said to him, “Put me where I can feel the columns that hold this temple up. I want to lean against them.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The temple was crowded with men and women. All the Philistine rulers were there. There were about 3000 men and women on the roof of the temple. They were laughing and making fun of Samson.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then Samson said a prayer to the LORD, “Lord GOD, remember me. God, please give me strength one more time. Let me do this one thing to punish these Philistines for tearing out both of my eyes!”  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then Samson took hold of the two columns in the center of the temple that supported the whole temple. He braced himself between the two columns. One column was at his right side and the other at his left side.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Samson said, “Let me die with these Philistines!” Then he pushed as hard as he could, and the temple fell on the rulers and everyone in it. In this way Samson killed many more Philistines when he died than when he was alive. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Samson’s brothers and all the people in his father’s family went down to get his body. They brought him back and buried him in his father’s tomb, which is between the cities of Zorah and Eshtaol. Samson was a judge for the Israelites for 20 years. </div><ul class='tnav'>
