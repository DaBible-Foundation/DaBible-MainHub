One morning, the man went out very early to hire some people to work in his vineyard.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He agreed to pay the workers one silver coin for working that day. Then he sent them into the vineyard to work. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>“About nine o’clock the man went to the marketplace and saw some other people standing there. They were doing nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>So he said to them, ‘If you go and work in my field, I will pay you what your work is worth.’  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So they went to work in the vineyard. </div><div class='p'>“The man went out again about twelve o’clock and again at three o’clock. Both times he hired some others to work in his vineyard.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>About five o’clock the man went to the marketplace again. He saw some other people standing there. He asked them, ‘Why did you stand here all day doing nothing?’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>“They said, ‘No one gave us a job.’ </div><div class='p'>“The man said to them, ‘Then you can go and work in my vineyard.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“At the end of the day, the owner of the field said to the boss of all the workers, ‘Call the workers and pay them all. Start by paying the last people I hired. Then pay all of them, ending with the ones I hired first.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“The workers who were hired at five o’clock came to get their pay. Each worker got one silver coin.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then the workers who were hired first came to get their pay. They thought they would be paid more than the others. But each one of them also received one silver coin.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>When they got their silver coin, they complained to the man who owned the land.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>They said, ‘Those people were hired last and worked only one hour. But you paid them the same as us. And we worked hard all day in the hot sun.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“But the man who owned the field said to one of them, ‘Friend, I am being fair with you. You agreed to work for one silver coin. Right?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So take your pay and go. I want to give the man who was hired last the same pay I gave you.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I can do what I want with my own money. Why would you be jealous because I am generous?’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>“So those who are last now will be first in the future. And those who are first now will be last in the future.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Talks Again About His Death </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 10:32–34; Lk. 18:31–34) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Jesus was going to Jerusalem. His twelve followers were with him. While they were walking, he gathered the followers together and spoke to them privately. He said to them,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>“We are going to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be handed over to the leading priests and the teachers of the law, and they will say he must die.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They will hand him over to the foreigners, who will laugh at him and beat him with whips, and then they will kill him on a cross. But on the third day after his death, he will be raised to life again.” </div><div class='s'>A Mother Asks a Special Favor </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 10:35–45) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then Zebedee’s wife came to Jesus and brought her sons. She bowed before Jesus and asked him to do something for her. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Jesus said, “What do you want?” </div><div class='p'>She said, “Promise that one of my sons will sit at your right side in your kingdom and the other at your left.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So Jesus said to the sons, “You don’t understand what you are asking. Can you drink from the cup<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> cup A symbol of suffering. Jesus used the idea of drinking from a cup to mean accepting the suffering he would face in the terrible events that were soon to come. Also in verse 23.</span></a> that I must drink from?” </div><div class='p'>The sons answered, “Yes, we can!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Jesus said to them, “It is true that you will drink from the cup that I drink from. But it is not for me to say who will sit at my right or my left. My Father has decided who will do that. He has prepared those places for them.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The other ten followers heard this and were angry with the two brothers.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So Jesus called the followers together. He said, “You know that the rulers of the non-Jewish people love to show their power over the people. And their important leaders love to use all their authority over the people.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But it should not be that way with you. Whoever wants to be your leader must be your servant.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Whoever wants to be first must serve the rest of you like a slave.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Do as I did: The Son of Man did not come for people to serve him. He came to serve others and to give his life to save many people.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Heals Two Blind Men </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 10:46–52; Lk. 18:35–43) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>When Jesus and his followers were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>There were two blind men sitting by the road. They heard that Jesus was coming by. So they shouted, “Lord, Son of David, please help us!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The people there criticized the blind men and told them to be quiet. But they shouted more and more, “Lord, Son of David, please help us!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Jesus stopped and said to them, “What do you want me to do for you?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>They answered, “Lord, we want to be able to see.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Jesus felt sorry for the blind men. He touched their eyes, and immediately they were able to see. Then they became followers of Jesus. </div><ul class='tnav'>
