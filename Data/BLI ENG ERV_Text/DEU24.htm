If that man is not pleased with her, he must write the divorce papers and give them to her. Then he must send her from his house.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>When she has left his house, she may go and become another man’s wife.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3-4&#160;</span>But suppose the new husband also does not like her and sends her away. If that man divorces her, the first husband may not take her again to be his wife. Or if the new husband dies, her first husband may not take her again to be his wife. She has become unclean to him. If he married her again, he would be doing something the LORD hates. You must not sin like this in the land that the LORD your God is giving you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“When a man is newly married, he must not be sent into the army.
