<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='s'>War Between Israel and Judah </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>There was war for a long time between Saul’s family and David’s family. David became stronger and stronger, but Saul’s family became weaker and weaker. </div><div class='s'>David’s Six Sons Born at Hebron </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>These are David’s sons who were born at Hebron: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='li'>The first son was Amnon. Amnon’s mother was Ahinoam from Jezreel. </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The second son was Kileab. His mother was Abigail, who had been the wife of Nabal from Carmel. </div><div class='li'>The third son was Absalom. Absalom’s mother was Maacah daughter of King Talmai of Geshur. </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The fourth son was Adonijah. Adonijah’s mother was Haggith. </div><div class='li'>The fifth son was Shephatiah. Shephatiah’s mother was Abital. </div><div class='li'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The sixth son was Ithream. Ithream’s mother was David’s wife Eglah. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'>These sons were all born at Hebron. </div><div class='s'>Abner Decides to Join David </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>As the families of Saul and David fought each other, Abner became more and more powerful in Saul’s army.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Saul had a slave woman named Rizpah daughter of Aiah. Ish Bosheth said to Abner, “Why did you have sexual relations with my father’s servant woman?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>This made Abner very angry. He said, “I have been loyal to Saul and his family. I did not give you to David. I am not a traitor working for Judah.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> I am not … Judah Literally, “Am I a dog’s head of Judah?”</span></a> But now you are saying that I did this bad thing.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9-10&#160;</span>The LORD promised with an oath that he would take the kingdom away from Saul’s family and give it to David. And I swear I will make sure that happens. God will make David king of Judah and Israel. He will rule from Dan to Beersheba.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Dan to Beersheba This means the whole nation of Israel, north and south. Dan was a town in the northern part of Israel and Beersheba was in the southern part of Judah.</span></a>”  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Ish Bosheth was too afraid of Abner to say anything in response. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Abner sent messengers to David and said, “Who do you think should rule this country? Make an agreement with me, and I will help you become the ruler of all the people of Israel.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>David answered, “Good! I will make an agreement with you. But I ask you only one thing: I will not meet with you until you bring Saul’s daughter Michal to me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>David sent messengers to Saul’s son Ish Bosheth. David said, “Give me my wife Michal. She was promised to me. I killed 100 Philistines to get her.”<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> I killed … to get her Literally, “I paid for her with 100 Philistine foreskins.” See 1 Sam. 18:20-30; 25:44.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then Ish Bosheth told the men to go and take Michal from a man named Paltiel son of Laish.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Michal’s husband, Paltiel, followed them, crying all the way to Bahurim. Finally, Abner said to him, “Go back home.” So Paltiel went back home. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Abner sent this message to the leaders of Israel. He said, “For a long time you have wanted to make David your king.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Now do it! The LORD was talking about David when he said, ‘I will save my people the Israelites from the Philistines and all their other enemies. I will do this through my servant David.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Abner said these things to David in Hebron, and he said these things to the people of the tribe of Benjamin. The things Abner said sounded good to the tribe of Benjamin and to all the people of Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then Abner came up to David at Hebron. Abner brought 20 men with him. David gave a party for Abner and for all the men who came with him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Abner said to David, “My lord and king, let me go bring all the Israelites to you. Then they will make an agreement with you, and you will rule over all Israel, as you wanted.” </div><div class='p'>So David let Abner leave in peace. </div><div class='s'>Abner’s Death </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Joab and David’s officers came back from battle. They had many valuable things that they had taken from the enemy. David had just let Abner leave in peace. So Abner was not there in Hebron with David.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Joab and all his army arrived at Hebron. The army said to Joab, “Abner son of Ner came to King David, and David let Abner leave in peace.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? Abner came to you, but you sent him away without hurting him! Why?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>You know Abner son of Ner. He came to trick you. He came to learn all about what you are doing.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Joab left David and sent messengers to Abner at the well of Sirah. The messengers brought Abner back, but David did not know this.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>When Abner arrived at Hebron, Joab met him in the gateway, pulled him aside to talk in private, and then stabbed him in the stomach. So he got his revenge against Abner. Joab killed Abner because Abner had killed Joab’s brother Asahel. </div><div class='s'>David Cries for Abner </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Later David heard the news and said, “My kingdom and I are innocent of the death of Abner son of Ner. The LORD knows this.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Joab and his family are responsible for this, and they will be cursed. Many troubles will come to his family. His people will be sick with leprosy, crippled, killed in war, and not have enough food to eat!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because Abner had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31-32&#160;</span>David said to Joab and to all the people with Joab, “Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth. Cry for Abner.” They buried Abner in Hebron. David went to the funeral. King David and all the people cried at Abner’s grave. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>King David sang this sad song at Abner’s funeral: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Did Abner die like some foolish criminal? </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Abner, your hands were not tied. </div><div class='q2'>Your feet were not put in chains. </div><div class='q'>No, Abner, evil men killed you!” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'>Then all the people cried again for Abner.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>All day long people came to encourage David to eat food. But David had made a special promise. He said, “May God punish me and give me many troubles if I eat bread or any other food before the sun goes down.”  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>All the people saw what happened, and they were pleased with what King David had done.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>All the people of Judah and Israel understood that King David had not killed Abner son of Ner. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>King David said to his officers, “You know that a very important leader died today in Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And it was on the very same day that I was anointed to be the king. These sons of Zeruiah have caused me a lot of trouble. May the LORD give them the punishment they deserve.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
