<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 21</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>To the LORD, a king’s mind is like a ditch used to water the fields. He can lead the king wherever he wants him to go. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>People think that whatever they do is right, but the LORD judges the reasons for everything they do. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Do what is right and fair. The LORD loves that more than sacrifices. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Proud looks and proud thoughts are sins. They show a person is evil. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Careful planning leads to profit. Acting too quickly leads to poverty. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Wealth that comes from telling lies disappears quickly and leads to death. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The bad things that evil people do will destroy them, because they refuse to do what is right. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Criminals cause trouble wherever they go, but good people are honest and fair. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>It is better to live in a small corner on the roof than to share the house with a woman who is always arguing. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Evil people always want to do more evil, and they show no mercy to people around them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>When you punish a proud person who laughs at what is right, even fools will learn something.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Or “Punish a rude, arrogant person, and the others will become wise.”</span></a> But a little instruction is enough for the wise to learn what they should. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>God is good. He knows what the wicked are doing, and he will punish them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Those who refuse to help the poor will not receive help when they need it themselves. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>If anyone is angry with you, give them a gift in private. A gift given in secret will calm even the strongest anger. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>A decision that is fair makes good people happy, but it makes those who are evil very afraid. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Whoever leaves the path of wisdom will be on their way to an early death. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Loving pleasure leads to poverty. Wine and luxury will never make you wealthy. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The wicked must pay for what happens to good people—the cheaters will be taken in exchange for the honest. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>It is better to live alone in the desert than with a quick-tempered wife who loves to argue. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Wise people save the nice things they have. Fools use up everything as soon as they get it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>People who try hard to do good and be faithful will find life, goodness, and honor. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>A wise person can defeat a city full of warriors and tear down the defenses they trust in. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>People who are careful about what they say will save themselves from trouble. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Proud people think they are better than others. They show they are evil by what they do. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Lazy people will cause their own destruction because they refuse to work. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Some people are greedy and never have enough. Good people are generous and have plenty. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>God hates sacrifices from the wicked, especially when their reason for offering them is evil. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Witnesses who lie will be caught and punished. A careful listener will always be there to speak up. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Good people know they are right, but the wicked have to pretend. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>There is no one wise enough to make a plan that can succeed if the LORD is against it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>You can prepare your horses for battle, but only the LORD can give you the victory. </div><ul class='tnav'>
