<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 32</div><div class='s'>Jacob Prepares to Meet Esau </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Jacob also left that place. While he was traveling, he saw God’s angels.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>When he saw them, he said, “This is God’s camp!” So Jacob named that place Mahanaim.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Mahanaim This name means “two camps.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Jacob’s brother Esau was living in the area called Seir in the hill country of Edom. Jacob sent messengers to Esau.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He told them, “Tell this to my master Esau: ‘Your servant Jacob says, I have lived with Laban all these years.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I have many cattle, donkeys, flocks, and servants. Sir, I am sending you this message to ask you to accept us.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The messengers came back to Jacob and said, “We went to your brother Esau. He is coming to meet you. He has 400 men with him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Jacob was very frightened and worried. He divided the people who were with him and all the flocks, herds, and camels into two groups.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Jacob thought, “If Esau comes and destroys one group, the other group can run away and be saved.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then Jacob said, “God of my father Abraham! God of my father Isaac! LORD, you told me to come back to my country and to my family. You said that you would do good to me.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>You have been very kind to me. You did many good things for me. The first time I traveled across the Jordan River, I owned nothing—only my walking stick. But now I own enough things to have two full groups.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I ask you to please save me from my brother Esau. I am afraid that he will come and kill us all, even the mothers with the children.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Lord, you said to me, ‘I will be good to you. I will increase your family and make your children as many as the sands of the sea. There will be too many to count.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Jacob stayed in that place for the night. He prepared some things to give to Esau as a gift.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He took 200 female goats and 20 male goats, 200 female sheep and 20 male sheep.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He took 30 camels and their colts, 40 cows and 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys and 10 male donkeys.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He gave each flock of animals to his servants. Then he said to them, “Separate each group of animals. Go ahead of me and keep some space between each herd.”  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Jacob gave them their orders. To the servant with the first group of animals he said, “When Esau my brother comes to you and asks you, ‘Whose animals are these? Where are you going? Whose servant are you?’  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>then you should answer, ‘These animals belong to your servant Jacob. He sent them as a gift to you, my master Esau. And he also is coming behind us.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Jacob also ordered the second servant, the third servant, and all the other servants to do the same thing. He said, “You will say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>You will say, ‘This is a gift to you, and your servant Jacob is behind us.’ ” </div><div class='p'>Jacob thought, “If I send these men ahead with gifts, maybe Esau will forgive me and accept me.”  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So Jacob sent the gifts to Esau, but he stayed that night in the camp. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>During the night, Jacob got up and began moving his two wives, his two maids, and his eleven sons across the Jabbok River at the crossing.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>After he sent his family across the river, he sent across everything he had. </div><div class='s'>The Fight With God </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Jacob was left alone, and a man came and wrestled with him. The man fought with him until the sun came up.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>When the man saw that he could not defeat Jacob, he touched Jacob’s leg and put it out of joint. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then the man said to Jacob, “Let me go. The sun is coming up.” </div><div class='p'>But Jacob said, “I will not let you go. You must bless me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the man said to him, “What is your name?” </div><div class='p'>And Jacob said, “My name is Jacob.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then the man said, “Your name will not be Jacob. Your name will now be Israel.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Israel This name might mean “he fights for God,” “he fights with God,” or “God fights.”</span></a> I give you this name because you have fought with God and with men, and you have won.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then Jacob asked him, “Please tell me your name.” </div><div class='p'>But the man said, “Why do you ask my name?” Then the man blessed Jacob at that place. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>So Jacob named that place Peniel.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Peniel A name that means “the face of God.”</span></a> He said, “At this place, I saw God face to face, but my life was spared.”  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then the sun came up as Jacob left Peniel. He was limping because of his leg.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>So even today, the people of Israel don’t eat the muscle that is on the hip joint, because this is the muscle where Jacob was hurt. </div><ul class='tnav'>
