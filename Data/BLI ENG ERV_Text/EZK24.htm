But I will destroy it, and your children that you left behind will be killed in battle.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But you will do the same things that I have done about my dead wife. You will not cover your mustache or eat the food people normally eat when someone dies.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>You will wear your turbans and your sandals. You will not show your sadness publicly or cry publicly, but you will waste away with guilt and talk to each other quietly about your grief.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So Ezekiel is an example for you. You will do all the same things he did. That time of punishment will come, and then you will know that I am the Lord GOD.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25-26&#160;</span>The Lord said, “Son of man, I will take away the place that makes the people feel safe—Jerusalem, that beautiful city that makes them so happy.

On that day one of the survivors will come to you with the bad news about Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>That same day you will be able to talk to the messenger. You will not be silent anymore. This will be a sign to the people, and they will know that I am the LORD.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
