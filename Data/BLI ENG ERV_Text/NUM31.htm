<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 31</div><div class='s'>Israel Fights Back Against the Midianites </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The LORD spoke to Moses and said,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>“Moses, tell the Israelites this: ‘Go and attack the Midianites, and do to them what they did to you.’ After that Moses, you will die.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> you will die Literally, “you will be gathered to your people.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So Moses spoke to the people. He said, “Choose some of your men to be soldiers. The LORD will use these men to do to the Midianites what they did to you.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Choose 1000 men from each of the tribes of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>There will be a total of 12,000 soldiers from the tribes of Israel.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Moses sent these 12,000 men to war. He sent Phinehas son of Eleazar with them as the priest. Phinehas took the holy things and the horns and trumpets with him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The Israelites fought the Midianites as the LORD had commanded. They killed all the Midianite men.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Among the people who they killed were Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba—the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with a sword. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The Israelites took the Midianite women and children as prisoners. They also took all their sheep, cattle, and other things.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then they burned all their towns and villages.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>They took all the people and animals  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and brought them to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the other Israelites. They brought all the things they took in war to the camp of Israel. The Israelites were camped in the Jordan Valley in Moab, on the east side of the Jordan River across from Jericho.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the people went out of the camp to meet with the soldiers. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Moses was very angry with the leaders of the army, the commanders of 1000 men, and the commanders of 100 men, who came back from the war.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Moses said to them, “Why did you let the women live?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>These are the women who listened to Balaam and caused the men of Israel to turn away from the LORD that time at Peor. The disease will come to the LORD’S people again.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Now, kill all the Midianite boys, and kill all the Midianite women who have had sexual relations with a man.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>You can let all the young girls live—but only if they never had sexual relations with any man.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And then, all you men who killed other people must stay outside the camp for seven days. You must stay outside the camp even if you just touched a dead body. On the third day you and your prisoners must make yourselves pure. You must do the same thing again on the seventh day.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>You must wash all of your clothes. You must wash anything made with leather, wool, or wood. You must purify yourselves.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then Eleazar the priest spoke to the soldiers. He said, “These are the rules that the LORD gave to Moses for soldiers coming back from war.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22-23&#160;</span>You must put gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, or lead into the fire and then wash these things with the special water to make them pure. If something can be put in the fire, you must put it in fire to purify it. If things cannot be put in fire, you must still wash them with the special water.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>On the seventh day you must wash all of your clothes. Then you will be pure. After that you can come into camp.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then the LORD said to Moses,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>“You, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders should count all the prisoners, animals, and everything the soldiers took in war.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then divide these things between the soldiers who went to war and the rest of the Israelites.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Take part of these things from the soldiers who went to war. That part will belong to the LORD. His share is one from every 500 items. This includes people, cattle, donkeys, and sheep.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Take that share from the soldiers’ half of the things they took in war. Then give these things to Eleazar the priest. That part will belong to the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And then, from the people’s half, take one thing for every 50 items. This includes people, cattle, donkeys, sheep, or any other animal. Give that share to the Levites, because they take care of the LORD’S Holy Tent.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>So Moses and Eleazar did what the LORD commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The soldiers had taken 675,000 sheep,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>72,000 cattle,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>61,000 donkeys,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>and 32,000 women. (These are only the women who had not had sexual relations with any man.)  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>The soldiers who went to war got 337,500 sheep.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>They gave 675 sheep to the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>The soldiers got 36,000 cattle. They gave 72 cattle to the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>The soldiers got 30,500 donkeys. They gave 61 donkeys to the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>The soldiers got 16,000 women. They gave 32 women to the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Moses gave all these gifts for the LORD to Eleazar the priest, as the LORD had commanded him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Then Moses counted the people’s half. This was their share that Moses had taken from the soldiers who had gone to war.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>The people got 337,500 sheep,  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>36,000 cattle,  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>30,500 donkeys,  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>and 16,000 women.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Moses took one out of every 50 women and animals. He gave them to the Levites because they took care of the LORD’S Holy Tent. Moses did this as the LORD had commanded. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Then the leaders of the army (the leaders over 1000 men and the leaders over 100 men) came to Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>They told Moses, “We, your servants, have counted our soldiers. We have not missed any of them.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>So we are bringing the LORD’S gift from every soldier. We are bringing things that are made of gold—armbands, bracelets, rings, earrings, and necklaces. This gift to the LORD is to make us pure.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>So Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted all these gold items from them.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>The gold that the commanders<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> commanders Literally, “leaders of 1000 men.”</span></a> and captains<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> captains Literally, “leaders of 100 men.”</span></a> gave to the LORD weighed about 424 pounds.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> 424 pounds Literally, “16,750 shekels” (190 kg).</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>The soldiers kept the rest of their share of the things they took in war.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the commanders and captains and then put that gold in the Meeting Tent. This present was a memorial<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> memorial Something that helps people remember things that happened in the past.</span></a> before the LORD for the Israelites. </div><ul class='tnav'>
