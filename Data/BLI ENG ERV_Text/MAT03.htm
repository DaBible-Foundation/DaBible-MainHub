This was out in the desert area of Judea.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>John said, “Change your hearts and lives, because God’s kingdom is now very near.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> is now very near Or “is coming soon” or “has come.”</span></a>”  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>John is the one Isaiah the prophet was talking about when he said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“There is someone shouting in the desert: </div><div class='q'>‘Prepare the way for the Lord. </div><div class='q2'>Make the road straight for him.’ ” <span class='rq'>Isaiah 40:3</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>John’s clothes were made from camel’s hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. For food, he ate locusts and wild honey.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>People came to John from Jerusalem and the rest of Judea and from all the areas along the Jordan River.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>They confessed the bad things they had done, and John baptized them in the Jordan. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Many Pharisees and Sadducees came to where John was baptizing people. When John saw them, he said, “You are all snakes! Who warned you to run from God’s judgment that is coming?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Change your hearts! And show by the way you live that you have changed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I know what you are thinking. You want to say, ‘but Abraham is our father!’ That means nothing. I tell you, God could make children for Abraham from these rocks.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The ax is now ready to cut down the trees.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> trees The people who don’t obey God.

But there is someone coming later who is able to do more than I can. I am not good enough to be the slave who takes off his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>He will come ready to clean the grain.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> clean the grain Meaning that Jesus will separate the good people from those who are bad.</span></a> He will separate the good grain from the straw, and he will put the good part into his barn.

He came to John, wanting John to baptize him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But John tried to stop him. John said, “Why do you come to me to be baptized? I should be baptized by you!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “Let it be this way for now. We should do whatever God says is right.” Then John agreed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So Jesus was baptized. As soon as he came up out of the water, the sky opened, and he saw God’s Spirit coming down on him like a dove.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>A voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, the one I love.
