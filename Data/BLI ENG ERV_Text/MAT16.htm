<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 16</div><div class='s'>Some People Doubt Jesus’ Authority </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 8:11–13; Lk. 12:54–56) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus. They wanted to test him. So they asked him to show them a miracle as a sign from God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “When you people see the sunset, you know what the weather will be. If the sky is red, you say we will have good weather.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And in the morning, if the sky is dark and red, you say that it will be a rainy day. These are signs of the weather. You see these signs in the sky and know what they mean. In the same way, you see the things that are happening now. These are also signs, but you don’t know their meaning.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>It is the evil and sinful people who want to see a miracle as a sign from God. But no miracle will be done to prove anything to them. The only sign will be the miracle that happened to Jonah.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Jonah A prophet in the Old Testament. After three days in a big fish he came out alive, just as Jesus would come out from the tomb on the third day.</span></a>” Then Jesus went away from there. </div><div class='s'>Jesus’ Followers Misunderstand Him </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 8:14–21) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Jesus and his followers went across the lake. But the followers forgot to bring bread.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Jesus said to the followers, “Be careful! Guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The followers discussed the meaning of this. They said, “Did Jesus say this because we forgot to bring bread?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Jesus knew that they were talking about this. So he asked them, “Why are you talking about not having bread? Your faith is small.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Do you still not understand? Remember the five loaves of bread that fed the 5000 people and the many baskets you filled with the bread that was left?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And remember the seven loaves of bread that fed the 4000 people and the many baskets you filled that time?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So how could you think that I am concerned about bread? I am telling you to be careful and guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then the followers understood what Jesus meant. He was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread. He was telling them to guard against the teaching of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. </div><div class='s'>Peter Says Jesus Is the Messiah </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 8:27–30; Lk. 9:18–21) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Jesus went to the area of Caesarea Philippi. He said to his followers, “Who do people say I am<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> I am Literally, “the Son of Man is.”</span></a>?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>They answered, “Some people say you are John the Baptizer. Others say you are Elijah. And some say you are Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then Jesus said to his followers, “And who do you say I am?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “You are blessed, Simon son of Jonah. No one taught you that. My Father in heaven showed you who I am.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>So I tell you, you are Peter.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Peter The Greek name “Peter,” like the Aramaic name “Cephas,” means “rock.”</span></a> And I will build my church on this rock. The power of death<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> power of death Literally, “gates of Hades.”</span></a> will not be able to defeat my church.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I will give you the keys to God’s kingdom. When you speak judgment here on earth, that judgment will be God’s judgment. When you promise forgiveness here on earth, that forgiveness will be God’s forgiveness.”<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> When you speak … God’s forgiveness Literally, “Whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will have been loosed in heaven.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then Jesus warned his followers not to tell anyone he was the Messiah. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Says He Must Die </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 8:31–9:1; Lk. 9:22–27) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>From that time Jesus began telling his followers that he must go to Jerusalem. He explained that the older Jewish leaders, the leading priests, and the teachers of the law would make him suffer many things. And he told his followers that he must be killed. Then, on the third day, he would be raised from death. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Peter took Jesus away from the other followers to talk to him alone. He began to criticize him. He said, “God save you from those sufferings, Lord! That will never happen to you!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then Jesus said to Peter, “Get away from me, Satan<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Satan Name for the devil meaning “the enemy.” Jesus means that Peter was talking like Satan.</span></a>! You are not helping me! You don’t care about the same things God does. You care only about things that people think are important.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then Jesus said to his followers, “If any of you want to be my follower, you must stop thinking about yourself and what you want. You must be willing to carry the cross that is given to you for following me.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Any of you who try to save the life you have will lose it. But you who give up your life for me will find true life.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>It is worth nothing for you to have the whole world if you yourself are lost. You could never pay enough to buy back your life.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The Son of Man will come again with his Father’s glory and with his angels. And he will reward everyone for what they have done.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Believe me when I say that there are some people standing here who will see the Son of Man coming with his kingdom before they die.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
