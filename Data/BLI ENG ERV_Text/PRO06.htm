<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 6</div><div class='s'>Dangers of Debt </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>My son, don’t make yourself responsible for the debts of others. Don’t make such deals with friends or strangers.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>If you do, your words will trap you.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>You will be under the power of other people, so you must go and free yourself. Beg them to free you from that debt.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Don’t wait to rest or sleep.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Escape from that trap like a deer running from a hunter. Free yourself like a bird flying from a trap. </div><div class='s'>The Dangers of Being Lazy </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>You lazy people, you should watch what the ants do and learn from them.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Ants have no ruler, no boss, and no leader.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But in the summer, ants gather all of their food and save it. So when winter comes, there is plenty to eat. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>You lazy people, how long are you going to lie there? When will you get up?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>You say, “I need a rest. I think I’ll take a short nap.”  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But then you sleep and sleep and become poorer and poorer. Soon you will have nothing. It will be as if a thief came and stole everything you owned. </div><div class='s'>Troublemakers </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Some people are just troublemakers. They are always thinking up some crooked plan and telling lies.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>They use secret signals to cheat people; they wink their eyes, shuffle their feet, and point a finger.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>They are always planning to do something bad.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But they will be punished. Disaster will strike, and they will be destroyed. There will be no one to help them. </div><div class='s'>What the Lord Hates </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The LORD hates these seven things: </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>eyes that show pride, </div><div class='q2'>tongues that tell lies, </div><div class='q2'>hands that kill innocent people, </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>hearts that plan evil things to do, </div><div class='q2'>feet that run to do evil, </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>witnesses in court who tell lies, </div><div class='q2'>and anyone who causes family members to fight. </div><div class='s'>Warning Against Adultery </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>My son, remember your father’s command, and don’t forget your mother’s teaching.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Remember their words always. Tie them around your neck and keep them over your heart.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let this teaching lead you wherever you go. It will watch over you while you sleep. And when you wake up, it will give you good advice. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Your parents give you commands and teachings that are like lights to show you the right way. This teaching corrects you and trains you to follow the path to life.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>It stops you from going to an evil woman, and it protects you from the smooth talk of another man’s wife.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Such a woman might be beautiful, but don’t let that beauty tempt you. Don’t let her eyes capture you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>A prostitute might cost a loaf of bread, but the wife of another man could cost you your life.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>If you drop a hot coal in your lap, your clothes will be burned.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>If you step on one, your feet will be burned.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>If you sleep with another man’s wife, you will be punished. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30-31&#160;</span>A hungry man might steal to fill his stomach. If he is caught, he must pay seven times more than he stole. It might cost him everything he owns, but other people understand. They don’t lose all their respect for him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But a man who commits adultery is a fool. He brings about his own destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>He will suffer disease and disgrace and never be free from the shame.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>The woman’s husband will be jealous and angry and do everything he can to get revenge.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>No payment—no amount of money—will stop him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
