<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 25</div><div class='s'>More Wise Sayings From Solomon </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>These are some more wise sayings from Solomon. These proverbs were copied by servants of Hezekiah, the king of Judah. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>We honor God for the things he keeps secret. But we honor kings for the things they can discover. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>We cannot discover how high the sky is above us or how deep the earth is below. The same is true with the minds of kings. We cannot understand them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Remove the worthless things from silver to make it pure, and a worker can make something beautiful.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Take the evil advisors away from a king, and goodness will make his kingdom strong. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Don’t brag about yourself before the king and pretend you are someone important.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>It is much better for the king to invite you to take a more important position than to embarrass you in front of his officials. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Don’t be too quick to tell a judge about something you saw. You will be embarrassed if someone else proves you wrong. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>If you want to tell your friends about your own problems, tell them. But don’t discuss what someone told you in private.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Whoever hears it will lose their respect for you and will never trust you again. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Saying the right thing at the right time is like a golden apple in a silver setting.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Wise advice to a listening ear is like gold earrings or fine jewelry. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>To his master who sent him, a messenger who can be trusted is as refreshing as a drink of cold water on a hot summer day.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> drink … day Literally, “as the cold snow at harvest time.” This probably refers to snow or ice brought down from Mt. Hermon in Lebanon.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>People who promise to give gifts but never give them are like clouds and wind that bring no rain. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>With patience, you can make anyone change their thinking, even a ruler. Gentle speech is very powerful. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Honey is good, but don’t eat too much of it, or you will be sick.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And don’t visit your neighbors’ homes too often, or they will begin to hate you. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>A person who gives false testimony against a neighbor is as deadly as a club, a sword, or a very sharp arrow.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Never depend on a liar in times of trouble. It’s like chewing with a bad tooth or walking with a crippled foot. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Singing happy songs to a sad person is as foolish as taking a coat off on a cold day or mixing soda and vinegar. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>If your enemies are hungry, give them something to eat. If they are thirsty, give them some water.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>This will make them feel the burning pain of shame,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> This … shame Literally, “for you will heap coals of fire on his head.”</span></a> and the LORD will reward you for being good to them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Just as wind blowing from the north brings rain, telling secrets brings anger. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>It is better to live in a small corner of the roof than to share the house with a woman who is always arguing. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Good news from a faraway place is like a cool drink of water when you are hot and thirsty. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Good people who don’t stand strong against evil are like springs that have been polluted or pools that have turned dirty and muddy. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Just as eating too much honey is not good, it is not good for people to always be looking for honor. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>People who cannot control themselves are like cities without walls to protect them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
