Who will move the stone for us?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then the women looked and saw that the stone was moved. The stone was very large, but it was moved away from the entrance.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The women walked into the tomb and saw a young man there wearing a white robe. He was sitting on the right side of the tomb. The women were afraid. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But the man said, “Don’t be afraid. You are looking for Jesus from Nazareth, the one who was killed on a cross. He has risen from death! He is not here. Look, here is the place they put him when he was dead.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Now go and tell his followers. And be sure to tell Peter. Tell them, ‘Jesus is going into Galilee and will be there before you come. You will see him there, as he told you before.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The women were very afraid and confused. They left the tomb and ran away.
