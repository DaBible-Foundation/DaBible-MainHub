</div><hr /><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Greetings from Paul. I was chosen to be an apostle of Christ Jesus. God chose me because that is what he wanted. Greetings also from Sosthenes, our brother in Christ. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>To God’s church in Corinth, you who have been made holy because you belong to Christ Jesus. You were chosen to be God’s holy people together with all people everywhere who trust in the Lord<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> who trust in the Lord Literally, “who call on the name of the Lord,” meaning to show faith in him by worshiping or praying to him for help.</span></a> Jesus Christ—their Lord and ours. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </div><div class='s'>Paul Gives Thanks to God </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I always thank my God for you because of the grace that he has given you through Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>In him you have been blessed in every way. You have been blessed in all your speaking and all your knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>This proves that what we told you about Christ is true.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Now you have every gift from God while you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to come again.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He will keep you strong until the end so that on the day when our Lord Jesus Christ comes, you will be free from all blame.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>God is faithful. He is the one who has chosen you to share life with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. </div><div class='s'>Stop Arguing With Each Other </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Brothers and sisters, by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, I beg all of you to agree with each other. You should not be divided into different groups. Be completely joined together again with the same kind of thinking and the same purpose. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>My brothers and sisters, some members of Chloe’s family told me that there are arguments among you.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>This is what I mean: One of you says, “I follow Paul,” and someone else says, “I follow Apollos.” Another says, “I follow Peter,”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Peter Literally, “Cephas,” the Aramaic name for Peter, one of Jesus’ twelve apostles. Both names mean “rock.” Also in 3:22; 9:6; 15:5.</span></a> and someone else says, “I follow Christ.”  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Christ cannot be divided into different groups. It wasn’t Paul who died on the cross for you, was it? Were you baptized in Paul’s name?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I am thankful because now no one can say that you were baptized in my name.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>(I also baptized the family of Stephanas, but I don’t remember that I myself baptized any others.)  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Christ did not give me the work of baptizing people. He gave me the work of telling the Good News. But he sent me to tell the Good News without using clever speech, which would take away the power that is in the cross<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> cross Paul uses the cross as a picture of the Good News, the story of Christ’s death to pay for people’s sins. The cross (Christ’s death) was God’s way to save people.</span></a> of Christ. </div><div class='s'>God’s Power and Wisdom in Christ Jesus </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The teaching about the cross seems foolish to those who are lost. But to us who are being saved it is the power of God.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>As the Scriptures say, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise. </div><div class='q2'>I will confuse the understanding of the intelligent.” <span class='rq'>Isaiah 29:14</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So what does this say about the philosopher, the law expert, or anyone in this world who is skilled in making clever arguments? God has made the wisdom of the world look foolish.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>This is what God in his wisdom decided: Since the world did not find him through its own wisdom, he used the message that sounds foolish to save those who believe it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The Jews ask for miraculous signs, and the Greeks want wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But this is the message we tell everyone: Christ was killed on a cross. This message is a problem for Jews, and to other people it is nonsense.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But Christ is God’s power and wisdom to the people God has chosen, both Jews and Greeks.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Even the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom. Even the weakness of God is stronger than human strength. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Brothers and sisters, God chose you to be his. Think about that! Not many of you were wise in the way the world judges wisdom. Not many of you had great influence, and not many of you came from important families.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise. He chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And God chose what the world thinks is not important—what the world hates and thinks is nothing. He chose these to destroy what the world thinks is important.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>God did this so that no one can stand before him and boast about anything.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>It is God who has made you part of Christ Jesus. And Christ has become for us wisdom from God. He is the reason we are right with God and pure enough to be in his presence. Christ is the one who set us free from sin.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>So, as the Scriptures say, “Whoever boasts should boast only about the Lord.”<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Jer. 9:24.</span></a> </div><ul class='tnav'>
