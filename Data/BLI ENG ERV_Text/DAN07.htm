<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 7</div><div class='s'>Daniel’s Dream About Four Animals </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>During the first year that Belshazzar<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> the first year … Belshazzar This was about 553 B.C.</span></a> was king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream. He saw these visions while he was lying on his bed, and he wrote what he had dreamed.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Daniel said, “I saw my vision at night. In the vision the wind was blowing from all four directions. These winds made the sea rough.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I saw four big animals and each one was different from the others. These four animals came up out of the sea. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>“The first animal looked like a lion, but it had wings like an eagle. As I watched, its wings were torn off. It was helped up from the ground, and it stood up on two feet like a human. Then it was given a human mind. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“Then I saw another animal there in front of me that looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, ‘Get up and eat all the meat you want!’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>“After that I noticed another animal in front of me. It looked like a leopard, but it had four wings on its back. This animal had four heads. It was given authority to rule. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>“After that, in my vision at night, I looked, and there in front of me was a fourth animal. It looked very cruel and terrifying. It looked very strong, with large iron teeth. This animal crushed and ate its victims and walked on whatever was left of them. This fourth animal was different from all the animals I saw before it. This animal had ten horns. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“While I was looking at the horns and thinking about them, another horn grew up among them. This was a little horn with eyes like a human. It also had a mouth that was bragging. Then the little horn pulled out three of the other horns. </div><div class='s'>Judgment of the Fourth Animal </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“As I was looking, thrones were put in their places, </div><div class='q2'>and the Ancient King<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Ancient King Literally, “Ancient of Days.” This name pictures God as a great king who has ruled since ancient times. Also in verses 10, 13, 22.</span></a> sat on his throne. </div><div class='q'>His clothes were as white as snow. </div><div class='q2'>His hair was as white as wool. </div><div class='q'>His throne was made from fire,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> fire Or “light.”</span></a> </div><div class='q2'>and its wheels were made from flames. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>A river of fire flowed out </div><div class='q2'>from in front of the Ancient King. </div><div class='q'>Millions of people were serving him. </div><div class='q2'>Hundreds of millions of people stood in front of him. </div><div class='q'>Court was ready to begin, </div><div class='q2'>and the books were opened. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>“I kept on looking because the little horn was bragging. I kept watching until finally the fourth animal was killed. Its body was destroyed, and it was thrown into the burning fire.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The authority and rule of the other animals had been taken from them. But they were permitted to live for a certain period of time. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“In my vision at night I looked, and there in front of me was someone who looked like a human being.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> someone … human being Or “a person, a real human being.” Literally, “like a son of man.” This means he looked like a normal person, not an angel or an animal.</span></a> He was coming on the clouds in the sky. He came up to the Ancient King, and the King’s servants brought him before the King. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>“The one who looked like a human being was given authority, glory, and complete ruling power. People from every nation and language group will serve him. His rule will last forever. His kingdom will continue forever. It will never be destroyed. </div><div class='s'>The Meaning of Daniel’s Dream </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>“I, Daniel, was confused and worried. The visions that went through my mind bothered me.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I went to someone who was standing there and asked him what all this meant. So he explained it to me.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He said, ‘The four great animals are four kingdoms that will come from the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But God’s holy people will receive the kingdom, and they will have the kingdom forever and ever.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>“Then I wanted to know what the fourth animal was and what it meant. The fourth animal was different from all the other animals. It was very terrible and had iron teeth and bronze claws. It was the animal that crushed and ate its victims and walked on whatever was left.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>I wanted to know about the ten horns that were on the fourth animal’s head and about the little horn that grew there. That little horn pulled out three of the other ten horns. That little horn had eyes and a mouth that kept on bragging, and it looked bigger than the other horns.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>As I was watching, this little horn began attacking and making war against God’s holy people and killing them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The little horn kept killing God’s holy people until the Ancient King came and judged him. The Ancient King announced his decision about the little horn. This judgment helped God’s holy people, and they received the kingdom. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>“And he explained this to me: ‘The fourth animal is a fourth kingdom that will come on the earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms. That fourth kingdom will destroy people all around the world. It will walk on and crush nations all around the world.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The ten horns are ten kings that will come from this fourth kingdom. After those ten kings are gone, another king will come. He will be different from the kings who ruled before him. He will defeat three of the other kings.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>This special king will say things against God Most High, and he will hurt and kill God’s special people. That king will try to change the times and laws that have already been set. God’s holy people will be under that king’s power for three and one-half years.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> three and one-half years Literally, “time, times and half time.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>“ ‘But the court will decide what should happen, and that king’s power will be taken away. His kingdom will end completely.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then God’s holy people will rule over the kingdom and all the people from all the kingdoms of earth.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> God’s holy people … earth Literally, “The rule and kingdom and greatness of the kingdoms under heaven will be given to the saints.”</span></a> This kingdom will last forever, and people from all the other kingdoms will respect and serve them.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>“And that was the end of the dream. I, Daniel, was very afraid. My face became very white from fear, and I did not tell the other people what I saw and heard.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
