This was the place David had prepared for the Temple. It had been the threshing floor of Araunah<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Araunah In Hebrew, “Ornan.”</span></a> the Jebusite.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Jebusite A person who lived in Jerusalem before the Israelites took the city. “Jebus” was the old name for Jerusalem.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Solomon started to build on the second day of the second month of his fourth year as king of Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>These are the measurements he used for building the foundation of God’s Temple, using the old cubit.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> the old cubit This was the Egyptian cubit, measuring about 20 3/8” (51.83 cm).</span></a> The foundation was 60 cubits<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> 60 cubits 102' 3/8” (31.1 m).</span></a> long and 20 cubits<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> 20 cubits 34' 1/8” (10.37 m).

Some of the Hebrew texts have “120 cubits high.”</span></a> He covered the inside of the porch with pure gold.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>He put panels made of cypress wood on the walls of the larger room. Then he put pure gold over the cypress panels and then put pictures of palm trees and chains on the gold.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He put valuable stones in the Temple for beauty. The gold he used was gold from Parvaim.<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Parvaim This was a place where there was much gold. It was probably in the country of Ophir.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He covered the inside of the Temple with the gold. He put the gold on the ceiling beams, doorposts, walls, and doors. He carved Cherub angels on the walls. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then he made the Most Holy Place. This room was 20 cubits long and 20 cubits wide. It was as wide as the Temple was. He put pure gold on the walls of the Most Holy Place. The gold weighed about 22 1/2 tons.<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> 22 1/2 tons Literally, “600 talents” (20,700 kg).</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The gold nails weighed 1 1/4 pounds.<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> 1 1/4 pounds Literally, “50 shekels” (575 g).</span></a> He covered the upper rooms with gold.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He made two Cherub angels to put in the Most Holy Place. The workers covered the Cherub angels with gold.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Each wing of the Cherub angels was 5 cubits<a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> 5 cubits 8' 6” (2.6 m).

The other wing touched one wing of the second Cherub angel.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the other wing of the second Cherub angel touched the wall on the other side of the room.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So the wings of the two Cherub angels together reached across the room—a total of 20 cubits. The Cherub angels stood facing the Holy Place.<a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> facing the Holy Place Or “facing each other.” The Holy Place is the room in the Temple that was used by the priests to do their daily service to God.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He made the curtain<a href="#FN12" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> curtain This curtain was a large piece of cloth that hung between the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place so that no one could see the LORD’S Box of the Agreement and Cherub angels that were in there.</span></a> from blue, purple, and red materials and expensive linen.

The top part of the two columns was 5 cubits long.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He made chains in a necklace and put them on the tops of the columns.
