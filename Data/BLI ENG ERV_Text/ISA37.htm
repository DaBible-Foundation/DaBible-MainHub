Then he put on sackcloth and went to the LORD’S Temple. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Hezekiah sent Eliakim, the palace manager, Shebna, the royal secretary, and the elders of the priests to the prophet, Isaiah son of Amoz. They wore the special clothes that showed they were sad and upset.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>They said to Isaiah, “King Hezekiah has commanded that today will be a special day for sorrow and sadness. It will be a very sad day—as sad as when a baby should be born, but there is not enough strength for the birth.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The commander’s master, the king of Assyria, has sent him to say bad things about the living God. Maybe the LORD your God will hear it and prove the enemy is wrong. So pray for those who are still left alive.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>When King Hezekiah’s officers came to Isaiah,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>he said to them, “Give this message to your master, Hezekiah: The LORD says, ‘Don’t be afraid of what you heard from the commanders! Don’t believe what those “boys” from the king of Assyria said to make fun of me.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Look, I will send a spirit against the king of Assyria. He will get a report that will make him return to his own country. And I will cut him down with a sword in his own country.’ ” </div><div class='s'>The Assyrian Army Leaves Jerusalem </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish. He found him at Libnah, fighting against that city.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then the king of Assyria got a report that said, “King Tirhakah<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Tirhakah This is probably Taharqa, the Pharaoh of Egypt about 690–664 B.C.</span></a> of Ethiopia is coming to fight you.” </div><div class='p'>So the king of Assyria sent messengers to Hezekiah again.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He told them, “Tell King Hezekiah of Judah these things: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='pi'>‘Don’t be fooled by the god you trust when he says, “Jerusalem will not be defeated by the king of Assyria.”  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>You have heard what the kings of Assyria did to all the other countries. We destroyed them completely. Will you be saved? No!  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Did the gods of those people save them? No, my ancestors destroyed them all. They destroyed the cities of Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden living in Tel Assar.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Where is the king of Hamath? The king of Arpad? The king of the city of Sepharvaim? The kings of Hena and Ivvah?’ ” </div><div class='s'>Hezekiah Prays to the Lord </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Hezekiah received the letters from the messengers and read them. Then he went up to the LORD’S Temple and laid the letters out in front of the LORD.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He prayed to the LORD:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>“LORD All-Powerful, God of Israel, you sit as King above the Cherub angels. You alone are the God who rules all the kingdoms on earth. You made heaven and earth.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>LORD, please pay attention and hear this. Open your eyes, LORD, and see what is happening. Listen to all the insults against the living God in the message Sennacherib sent!  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>It is true, LORD. The kings of Assyria did destroy all those nations.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They did throw the gods of those nations into the fire, but they were not real gods. They were only wood and stone—statues that people made. That is why the kings of Assyria could destroy them.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But you are the LORD our God, so please save us from the king of Assyria. Then all the other nations will know that you are the LORD, the only God.” </div><div class='s'>God Answers Hezekiah </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent this message to Hezekiah: “The LORD, the God of Israel, says, ‘You prayed to me about the message that came from King Sennacherib of Assyria.

You will not be able to plant seeds this year, so next year you will eat grain that grew wild from the previous year’s crop. But in the third year, you will eat grain from seeds that you planted. You will harvest your crops, and you will have plenty to eat. You will plant vineyards and eat grapes from them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>“The people from the family of Judah who have escaped and are left alive will be like plants that send their roots deep into the ground and produce fruit above the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>That is because a few people will come out of Jerusalem alive. There will be survivors coming from Mount Zion.” The strong love<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> strong love The Hebrew word can mean strong feelings such as zeal, jealousy, or love.</span></a> of the LORD All-Powerful will do this. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>So the LORD says this about the king of Assyria: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“He will not come into this city </div><div class='q2'>or shoot an arrow here. </div><div class='q'>He will not bring his shields up against this city </div><div class='q2'>or build up a hill of dirt to attack its walls. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>He will go back the way he came. </div><div class='q2'>He will not come into this city. </div><div class='q2'>The LORD says this! </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>I will protect this city and save it. </div><div class='q2'>I will do this for myself and for my servant David.” </div><div class='s'>The Assyrian Army Is Destroyed </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>That night the angel of the LORD went out and killed 185,000 men in the Assyrian camp.
