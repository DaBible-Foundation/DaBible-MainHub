<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 15</div><div class='s'>God’s Law and Human Traditions </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 7:1–23) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus. They came from Jerusalem and asked him,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>“Why do your followers not obey the traditions we have from our great leaders who lived long ago? Your followers don’t wash their hands before they eat!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “And why do you refuse to obey God’s command so that you can follow those traditions you have?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>God said, ‘You must respect your father and mother.’<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Ex. 20:12; Deut. 5:16.</span></a> And God also said, ‘Whoever says anything bad to their father or mother must be killed.’<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Ex. 21:17.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But you teach that a person can say to their father or mother, ‘I have something I could use to help you. But I will not use it for you. I will give it to God.’  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>You are teaching them not to respect their father. So you are teaching that it is not important to do what God said. You think it is more important to follow those traditions you have.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>You are hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he spoke for God about you: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>‘These people honor me with their words, </div><div class='q2'>but I am not really important to them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Their worship of me is worthless. </div><div class='q2'>The things they teach are only human rules.’ ” <span class='rq'>Isaiah 29:13</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Jesus called the people to him. He said, “Listen and understand what I am saying.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>It is not what people put in their mouth that makes them wrong.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> wrong Literally, “unclean” or “not pure,” meaning unacceptable to God. Also in verse 18.</span></a> It is what comes out of their mouth that makes them wrong.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then the followers came to Jesus and asked, “Do you know that the Pharisees are upset about what you said?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “Every plant that my Father in heaven has not planted will be pulled up by the roots.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Stay away from the Pharisees. They lead the people, but they are like blind men leading other blind men. And if a blind man leads another blind man, both of them will fall into a ditch.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Peter said, “Explain to us what you said earlier to the people.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Jesus said, “Do you still have trouble understanding?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Surely you know that all the food that enters the mouth goes into the stomach. Then it goes out of the body.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But the bad things people say with their mouth come from the way they think. And that’s what can make people wrong.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>All these bad things begin in the mind: evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual sins, stealing, lying, and insulting people.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>These are the things that make people wrong. Eating without washing their hands will never make people unacceptable to God.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Helps a Non-Jewish Woman </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 7:24–30) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Jesus went from there to the area of Tyre and Sidon.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>A Canaanite woman from that area came out and began shouting, “Lord, Son of David, please help me! My daughter has a demon inside her, and she is suffering very much.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But Jesus did not answer her. So the followers came to him and said, “Tell her to go away. She keeps crying out and will not leave us alone.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “God sent me only to the lost people<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> people Literally, “sheep.”</span></a> of Israel.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then the woman came over to Jesus and bowed before him. She said, “Lord, help me!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He answered her with this saying: “It is not right to take the children’s bread and give it to the dogs.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The woman said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the pieces of food that fall from their master’s table.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then Jesus answered, “Woman, you have great faith! You will get what you asked for.” And right then the woman’s daughter was healed. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Heals Many People </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then Jesus went from there to the shore of Lake Galilee. He went up on a hill and sat down. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>A large crowd of people came to him. They brought many other sick people and put them before him. There were people who could not walk, people who were blind, crippled, or deaf, and many others. Jesus healed them all.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>People were amazed when they saw that those who could not speak were now able to speak. Crippled people were made strong. Those who could not walk were now able to walk. The blind were able to see. Everyone thanked the God of Israel for this. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Feeds More Than 4000 </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 8:1–10) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Jesus called his followers to him and said, “I feel sorry for these people. They have been with me three days, and now they have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away hungry. They might faint while going home.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>The followers asked Jesus, “Where can we get enough bread to feed all these people? We are a long way from any town.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Jesus asked, “How many loaves of bread do you have?” </div><div class='p'>They answered, “We have seven loaves of bread and a few small fish.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Jesus told the people to sit on the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>He took the seven loaves of bread and the fish. Then he gave thanks to God for the food. He broke the bread into pieces, which he gave to the followers, and they gave the food to the people.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>All the people ate until they were full. After this, the followers filled seven baskets with the pieces of food that were not eaten.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>There were about 4000 men there who ate. There were also some women and children.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>After they all ate, Jesus told the people they could go home. He got into the boat and went to the area of Magadan. </div><ul class='tnav'>
