They took their land to make their own countries larger.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So, as surely as I am alive, Moab and the people of Ammon will be destroyed like Sodom and Gomorrah. I am the LORD All-Powerful, the God of Israel, and I promise those countries will be destroyed completely forever. Their land will be overgrown with weeds. It will be like the land covered with salt by the Dead Sea. The survivors of my people will take that land and everything left in it.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>This will happen to the people of Moab and Ammon because they were so proud and cruel and humiliated the people of the LORD All-Powerful.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>They will be afraid of the LORD, because he will destroy their gods.
