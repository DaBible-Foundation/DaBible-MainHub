I chose another man named Hananiah to be the commander of the fort. I picked Hanani because he was a very honest man and he feared God more than most people do.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then I said to Hanani and Hananiah, “Each day you must wait until the sun has been up for several hours before you open the gates of Jerusalem. You must shut and lock the gates before the sun goes down. Also choose people who live in Jerusalem as guards. Put some of them at special places to guard the city, and put the other people near their own houses.” </div><div class='s'>The List of Captives Who Returned </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Now the city was large and there was plenty of room.

I called together all the important people, the officials, and the common people. I did this so that I could make a list of all the families. I found the family lists<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> family lists See Ezra 2.</span></a> of the people who had been the first to return from captivity.
