<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 4</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And we still have the promise that God gave those people. That promise is that we can enter his place of rest. So we should be very careful that none of you fails to get that promise.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Yes, the good news about it was told to us just as it was to them. But the message they heard did not help them. They heard it but did not accept it with faith.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Only we who believe it are able to enter God’s place of rest. As God said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“I was angry and made a promise: </div><div class='q2'>‘They will never enter my place of rest.’ ” <span class='rq'>Psalm 95:11</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'>But God’s work was finished from the time he made the world.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Yes, somewhere in the Scriptures he talked about the seventh day of the week. He said, “So on the seventh day God rested from all his work.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Gen. 2:2.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But in the Scripture above God said, “They will never enter my place of rest.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So the opportunity is still there for some to enter and enjoy God’s rest. But those who first heard the good news about it did not enter, because they did not obey.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So God planned another special day. It is called “today.” He spoke about that day through David a long time later using the words we quoted before: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“If you hear God’s voice today, </div><div class='q2'>don’t be stubborn.” <span class='rq'>Psalm 95:7-8</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>We know that Joshua did not lead the people into the place of rest that God promised. We know this because God spoke later about another day for rest.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>This shows that the seventh-day rest<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> seventh-day rest Literally, “Sabbath rest,” meaning a sharing in the rest God began after he created the world.</span></a> for God’s people is still to come.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>God rested after he finished his work. So everyone who enters God’s place of rest will also have rest from their own work just as God did.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So let us try as hard as we can to enter God’s place of rest. We must try hard so that none of us will be lost by following the example of those who refused to obey God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>God’s word<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> God’s word God’s teachings and commands.</span></a> is alive and working. It is sharper than the sharpest sword and cuts all the way into us. It cuts deep to the place where the soul and the spirit are joined. God’s word cuts to the center of our joints and our bones. It judges the thoughts and feelings in our hearts.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Nothing in all the world can be hidden from God. He can clearly see all things. Everything is open before him. And to him we must explain the way we have lived. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Christ Is Our High Priest </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>We have a great high priest who has gone to live with God in heaven. He is Jesus the Son of God. So let us continue to express our faith in him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Jesus, our high priest, is able to understand our weaknesses. When Jesus lived on earth, he was tempted in every way. He was tempted in the same ways we are tempted, but he never sinned.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>With Jesus as our high priest, we can feel free to come before God’s throne where there is grace. There we receive mercy and kindness to help us when we need it. </div><ul class='tnav'>
