Don’t forget what I have told you.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Consider my teaching as precious as your own eyes. Obey my commands, and you will have a good life.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Tie them around your finger. Write them on your heart.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Treat wisdom like the woman you love and knowledge like the one dearest to you.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Wisdom will save you from that other woman, the other man’s wife, who tempts you with such sweet words. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>One day I was looking out my window  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>at some foolish teenagers and noticed one who had no sense at all.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He was walking through the marketplace and came to the corner where a certain woman lived. He then turned up the road that goes by her house.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The day was ending. The sun had set, and it was almost dark.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Suddenly, there she was in front of him, dressed like a prostitute. She had plans for him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>She was a wild and rebellious woman who would not stay at home.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>She walked the streets, always looking for someone to trap.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>She grabbed the young man and kissed him. Without shame, she looked him in the eye and said,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>“I offered a fellowship offering today. I gave what I promised to give,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and I still have plenty of food left. So I came out to find you, and here you are!  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I have clean sheets on my bed—special ones from Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>My bed smells wonderful with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Come, let’s enjoy ourselves all night. We can make love until dawn.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>My husband has gone on a business trip.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>He took enough money for a long trip and won’t be home for two weeks.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> won’t be … weeks Literally, “will not come home until the full moon.” The fellowship offering (see verse 14) was usually at the time of the new moon, the first day of the Hebrew month, which was two weeks before the full moon.</span></a>” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>This is what the woman said to tempt the young man, and her smooth words tricked him.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>He followed her, like a bull being led to the slaughter. He was like a deer walking into a trap,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>where a hunter waits to shoot an arrow through its heart. The boy was like a bird flying into a net, never seeing the danger he was in. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Now, sons, listen to me. Pay attention to what I say.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Don’t let your heart lead you to an evil woman like that. Don’t go where she wants to lead you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>She has brought down some of the most powerful men; she has left many dead bodies in her path.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Her house is the place of death. The road to it leads straight to the grave. </div><ul class='tnav'>
