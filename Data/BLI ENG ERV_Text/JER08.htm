They will take the bones of all the people of Jerusalem from their tombs.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>They will spread the bones on the ground under the sun, the moon, and the stars. The people of Jerusalem love to worship the sun, the moon, and the stars. No one will gather the bones and bury them again.
