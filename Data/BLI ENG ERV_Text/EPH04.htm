<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 4</div><div class='s'>The Unity of the Body </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>So, as a prisoner for the Lord, I beg you to live the way God’s people should live, because he chose you to be his.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Always be humble and gentle. Be patient and accept each other with love.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>You are joined together with peace through the Spirit. Do all you can to continue as you are, letting peace hold you together.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>There is one body and one Spirit, and God chose you to have one hope.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>There is one Lord, one faith, and one baptism.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>There is one God and Father of us all, who rules over everyone. He works through all of us and in all of us. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Christ gave each one of us a special gift. Everyone received what he wanted to give them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>That is why the Scriptures say, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“He went up high into the sky; </div><div class='q2'>he took prisoners with him, </div><div class='q2'>and he gave gifts to people.” <span class='rq'>Psalm 68:18</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>When it says, “He went up,” what does it mean? It means that he first came down low to earth.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So Christ came down, and he is the same one who went up. He went up above the highest heaven in order to fill everything with himself.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And that same Christ gave these gifts to people: He made some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to go and tell the Good News, and some to care for and teach God’s people.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> to care for … people Literally, “to be shepherds and teachers.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Christ gave these gifts to prepare God’s holy people for the work of serving, to make the body of Christ stronger.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>This work must continue until we are all joined together in what we believe and in what we know about the Son of God. Our goal is to become like a full-grown man—to look just like Christ and have all his perfection. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then we will no longer be like babies. We will not be people who are always changing like a ship that the waves carry one way and then another. We will not be influenced by every new teaching we hear from people who are trying to deceive us—those who make clever plans and use every kind of trick to fool others into following the wrong way.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>No, we will speak the truth with love. We will grow to be like Christ in every way. He is the head,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and the whole body depends on him. All the parts of the body are joined and held together, with each part doing its own work. This causes the whole body to grow and to be stronger in love. </div><div class='s'>The Way You Should Live </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I have something from the Lord to tell you. I warn you: Don’t continue living like those who don’t believe. Their thoughts are worth nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They have no understanding, and they know nothing because they refuse to listen. So they cannot have the life that God gives.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They have lost their feeling of shame and use their lives to do what is morally wrong. More and more they want to do all kinds of evil.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But that way of life is nothing like what you learned when you came to know Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I know that you heard about him, and in him you were taught the truth. Yes, the truth is in Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>You were taught to leave your old self. This means that you must stop living the evil way you lived before. That old self gets worse and worse, because people are fooled by the evil they want to do.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>You must be made new in your hearts and in your thinking.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Be that new person who was made to be like God, truly good and pleasing to him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So you must stop telling lies. “You must always speak the truth to each other,”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Zech. 8:16.</span></a> because we all belong to each other in the same body.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>“When you are angry, don’t let that anger make you sin,”<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Ps. 4:4 (Greek version).</span></a> and don’t stay angry all day.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Don’t give the devil a way to defeat you.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Whoever has been stealing must stop it and start working. They must use their hands for doing something good. Then they will have something to share with those who are poor. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>When you talk, don’t say anything bad. But say the good things that people need—whatever will help them grow stronger. Then what you say will be a blessing to those who hear you.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And don’t make the Holy Spirit sad. God gave you his Spirit as proof that you belong to him and that he will keep you safe until the day he makes you free.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Never be bitter, angry, or mad. Never shout angrily or say things to hurt others. Never do anything evil.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Be kind and loving to each other. Forgive each other the same as God forgave you through Christ. </div><ul class='tnav'>
