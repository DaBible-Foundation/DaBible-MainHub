<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 10</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Brothers and sisters, what I want most is for all the people of Israel to be saved. That is my prayer to God.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I can say this about them: They really try hard to follow God, but they don’t know the right way.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>They did not know the way that God makes people right with him. And they tried to make themselves right in their own way. So they did not accept God’s way of making people right.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Christ ended the law so that everyone who believes in him is made right with God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Moses writes about being made right by following the law. He says, “The person who obeys these laws is the one who will have life through them.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Lev. 18:5.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But this is what the Scriptures say about being made right through faith: “Don’t say to yourself, ‘Who will go up into heaven?’ ” (This means “Who will go up to heaven to get Christ and bring him down to earth?”)  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>“And don’t say, ‘Who will go down into the world below?’ ” (This means “Who will go down to get Christ and bring him up from death?”) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>This is what the Scripture says: “God’s teaching is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart.”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quotes from Deut. 30:12-14.</span></a> It is the teaching of faith that we tell people.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>If you openly say, “Jesus is Lord” and believe in your heart that God raised him from death, you will be saved.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Yes, we believe in Jesus deep in our hearts, and so we are made right with God. And we openly say that we believe in him, and so we are saved. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Yes, the Scriptures say, “Anyone who trusts in him will never be disappointed.”<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Isa. 28:16.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>It says this because there is no difference between those who are Jews and those who are not. The same Lord is the Lord of all people. And he richly blesses everyone who looks to him for help.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Yes, “everyone who trusts in the Lord<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> who trusts in the Lord Literally, “who calls on the name of the Lord,” meaning to show faith in him by worshiping him or praying to him for help.</span></a> will be saved.”<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Joel 2:32.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But before people can pray to the Lord for help, they must believe in him. And before they can believe in the Lord, they must hear about him. And for anyone to hear about the Lord, someone must tell them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And before anyone can go and tell them, they must be sent. As the Scriptures say, “How wonderful it is to see someone coming to tell good news!”<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Isa. 52:7.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But not all the people accepted that good news. Isaiah said, “Lord, who believed what we told them?”<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Isa. 53:1.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So faith comes from hearing the Good News. And people hear the Good News when someone tells them about Christ. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But I ask, “Did those people not hear the Good News?” Yes, they heard—as the Scriptures say, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Their voices went out all around the world. </div><div class='q2'>Their words went everywhere in the world.” <span class='rq'>Psalm 19:4</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Again I ask, “Did the people of Israel not understand?” Yes, they did understand. First, Moses says this for God: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“I will use those who are not really a nation to make you jealous. </div><div class='q2'>I will use a nation that does not understand to make you angry.” <span class='rq'>Deuteronomy 32:21</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then Isaiah is bold enough to say this for God: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“The people who were not looking for me— </div><div class='q2'>they are the ones who found me. </div><div class='q'>I made myself known to those who did not ask for me.” <span class='rq'>Isaiah 65:1</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But about the people of Israel God says, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“All day long I stood ready to accept those people, </div><div class='q2'>but they are stubborn and refuse to obey me.” <span class='rq'>Isaiah 65:2</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><ul class='tnav'>
