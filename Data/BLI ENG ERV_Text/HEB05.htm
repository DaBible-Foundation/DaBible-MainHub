That priest is given the work of helping people with the things they must do for God. He must offer to God gifts and sacrifices for sins.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The high priest has his own weaknesses. So he is able to be gentle with those who do wrong out of ignorance.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>He offers sacrifices for their sins, but he must also offer sacrifices for his own sins. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>To be a high priest is an honor. But no one chooses himself for this work. That person must be chosen by God just as Aaron was.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>It is the same with Christ. He did not choose himself to have the honor of becoming a high priest. But God chose him. God said to him, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“You are my Son. </div><div class='q2'>Today I have become your Father.” <span class='rq'>Psalm 2:7</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And in another part of the Scriptures God says, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“You are a priest forever— </div><div class='q2'>the kind of priest Melchizedek was.” <span class='rq'>Psalm 110:4</span> </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>While Jesus lived on earth he prayed to God, asking for help from the one who could save him from death. He prayed to God with loud cries and tears. And his prayers were answered because of his great respect for God.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Jesus was the Son of God, but he still suffered, and through his sufferings he learned to obey whatever God says.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>This made him the perfect high priest, who provides the way for everyone who obeys him to be saved forever.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>God made him high priest, just like Melchizedek. </div><div class='s'>Warning Against Falling Away </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>We have many things to tell you about this. But it is hard to explain because you have stopped trying to understand.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>You have had enough time that by now you should be teachers. But you need someone to teach you again the first lessons of God’s teaching. You still need the teaching that is like milk. You are not ready for solid food.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Anyone who lives on milk is still a baby and is not able to understand much about living right.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But solid food is for people who have grown up. From their experience they have learned to see the difference between good and evil. </div><ul class='tnav'>
