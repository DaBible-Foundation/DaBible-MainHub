<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 7</div><div class='s'>Jesus and His Brothers </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>After this, Jesus traveled around the country of Galilee. He did not want to travel in Judea, because the Jewish leaders there wanted to kill him.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>It was time for the Jewish Festival of Shelters.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So his brothers said to him, “You should leave here and go to the festival in Judea. Then your followers there can see the miracles you do.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>If you want to be well known, you must not hide what you do. So, if you can do such amazing things, let the whole world see you do them.”  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Jesus’ brothers said this because even they did not believe in him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Jesus said to them, “The right time for me has not yet come, but any time is right for you to go.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The world cannot hate you. But the world hates me, because I tell the people in the world that they do evil things.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So you go to the festival. I will not go now, because the right time for me has not yet come.”  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>After Jesus said this, he stayed in Galilee. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So his brothers left to go to the festival. After they left, Jesus went too, but he did not let people see him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>At the festival the Jewish leaders were looking for him. They said, “Where is that man?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>There was a large group of people there. Many of them were talking secretly to each other about Jesus. Some people said, “He is a good man.” But others said, “No, he fools the people.”  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But no one was brave enough to talk about him openly. They were afraid of the Jewish leaders. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Teaches in Jerusalem </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>When the festival was about half finished, Jesus went to the Temple area and began to teach.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The Jewish leaders were amazed and said, “How did this man learn so much? He never had the kind of teaching we had!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “What I teach is not my own. My teaching comes from the one who sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>People who really want to do what God wants will know that my teaching comes from God. They will know that this teaching is not my own.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>If I taught my own ideas, I would just be trying to get honor for myself. But if I am trying to bring honor to the one who sent me, I can be trusted. Anyone doing that is not going to lie.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Moses gave you the law, right? But you don’t obey that law. If you do, then why are you trying to kill me?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The people answered, “A demon is making you crazy! We are not trying to kill you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Jesus said to them, “I did one miracle on a Sabbath day, and you were all surprised.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But you obey the law Moses gave you about circumcision—and sometimes you do it on a Sabbath day. (Really, Moses is not the one who gave you circumcision. It came from our ancestors who lived before Moses.) Yes, you often circumcise baby boys on a Sabbath day.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>This shows that someone can be circumcised on a Sabbath day to obey the Law of Moses. So why are you angry with me for healing a person’s whole body on the Sabbath day?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Stop judging by the way things look. Be fair and judge by what is really right.” </div><div class='s'>People Wonder if Jesus Is the Messiah </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then some of the people who lived in Jerusalem said, “This is the man they are trying to kill.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But he is teaching where everyone can see and hear him. And no one is trying to stop him from teaching. Maybe the leaders have decided that he really is the Messiah.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But when the real Messiah comes, no one will know where he comes from. And we know where this man’s home is.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Jesus was still teaching in the Temple area when he said loudly, “Do you really know me and where I am from? I am here, but not by my own decision. I was sent by one who is very real. But you don’t know him.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>I know him because I am from him. He is the one who sent me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>When Jesus said this, the people tried to grab him. But no one was able even to touch him, because the right time for him had not yet come.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But many of the people believed in Jesus. They said, “We are waiting for the Messiah to come. When he comes, will he do more miraculous signs than this man has done?” </div><div class='s'>The Jewish Leaders Try to Arrest Jesus </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The Pharisees heard what the people were saying about Jesus. So the leading priests and the Pharisees sent some Temple police to arrest him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Then Jesus said, “I will be with you a little while longer. Then I will go back to the one who sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>You will look for me, but you will not find me. And you cannot come where I am.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>These Jews said to each other, “Where will this man go that we cannot find him? Will he go to the Greek cities where our people live? Will he teach the Greek people there?  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>He says, ‘You will look for me, but you will not find me.’ He also says, ‘You cannot come where I am.’ What does this mean?” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Talks About the Holy Spirit </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>The last day of the festival came. It was the most important day. On that day Jesus stood up and said loudly, “Whoever is thirsty may come to me and drink.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>If anyone believes in me, rivers of living water will flow out from their heart. That is what the Scriptures say.”  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Jesus was talking about the Spirit. The Spirit had not yet been given to people, because Jesus had not yet been raised to glory. But later, those who believed in Jesus would receive the Spirit. </div><div class='s'>The People Argue About Jesus </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>When the people heard the things that Jesus said, some of them said, “This man really is the Prophet.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Prophet They probably meant the prophet that God told Moses he would send. See Deut. 18:15-19.</span></a>” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Other people said, “He is the Messiah.” </div><div class='p'>And others said, “The Messiah will not come from Galilee.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>The Scriptures say that the Messiah will come from the family of David. And they say that he will come from Bethlehem, the town where David lived.”  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>So the people did not agree with each other about Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Some of the people wanted to arrest him. But no one tried to do it. </div><div class='s'>The Jewish Leaders Refuse to Believe </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>The Temple police went back to the leading priests and the Pharisees. The priests and the Pharisees asked, “Why didn’t you bring Jesus?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>The Temple police answered, “We have never heard anyone say such amazing things!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>The Pharisees answered, “So he has fooled you too!  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>You don’t see any of the leaders or any of us Pharisees believing in him, do you?  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>But those people out there know nothing about the law. They are under God’s curse!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>But Nicodemus was there in that group.
