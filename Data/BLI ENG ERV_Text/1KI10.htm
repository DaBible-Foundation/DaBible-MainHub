There were many camels carrying spices, jewels, and a lot of gold. She met Solomon and asked him all the questions that she could think of.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Solomon answered all the questions. None of her questions was too hard for him to explain.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The queen of Sheba saw that Solomon was very wise. She also saw the beautiful palace he had built.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>She saw the food at the king’s table. She saw his officials meeting together. She saw the servants in the palace and the good clothes they wore. She saw his parties and the sacrifices that he offered in the LORD’S Temple. She was so amazed, she could hardly breathe! </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then she said to King Solomon, “The stories I heard in my country about your great works and your wisdom are true.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I did not believe it until I came and saw it with my own eyes. Now I see that it is even greater than what I heard. Your wealth and wisdom are much greater than people told me.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Your wives<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> wives This is from the ancient Greek version. The Hebrew text has “men.”</span></a> and officers are very fortunate, because they serve you and hear your wisdom every day.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Praise the LORD your God! He was pleased to make you king of Israel. Because of the LORD’S unending love for Israel, he has made you king to rule with justice and fairness.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon 4 1/2 tons<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> 4 1/2 tons Literally, “120 talents” (4140 kg).</span></a> of gold, a huge amount of spices, and precious stones. She gave him more spices than anyone has ever brought into Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Hiram’s ships brought gold from Ophir. They also brought jewels and a special kind of wood.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> special … wood Literally, “almug.” No one knows exactly what type of wood this was, but it might have been sandalwood.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Solomon used this special wood to build supports in the Temple and the palace as well as harps and lyres for the singers. That was the last time such a large shipment of that kind of wood was brought to Israel. There hasn’t been any seen around here since then.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> since then Literally, “to this day,” that is, when the book of Kings was written.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she asked for. He gave her more than she brought to give him. Then the queen of Sheba and her servants left and went back to their own country. </div><div class='s'>Solomon’s Great Wealth </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Every year King Solomon received almost 25 tons<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> almost 25 tons Literally, “666 talents” (22,977 kg).</span></a> of gold.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>In addition to the gold brought in by the traveling merchants and traders, all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land also brought gold and silver to Solomon. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>King Solomon made 200 large shields of hammered gold. He used about 15 pounds<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> about 15 pounds Literally, “600 <span class='add'>shekels</span>” (6.9 kg).

He used almost 4 pounds<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> almost 4 pounds Literally, “3 <span class='tl'>minas</span>” (1.7kg).</span></a> of gold for each shield. The king put them in the Forest-of-Lebanon House.<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Forest-of-Lebanon House The largest of king Solomon’s palace buildings. See 1 Kings 7:2-5.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>King Solomon also built a large throne with ivory decorations. It was covered with pure gold.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>There were six steps leading up to the throne. The back of the throne was round at the top. There were armrests on both sides of the throne, and there were lions in the sides of the throne under the armrests.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>There were also two lions on each of the six steps, one at each end. There was nothing like it in any other kingdom. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>All of Solomon’s cups and glasses were made of gold, and all the dishes<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> dishes The Hebrew word can mean “dishes,” “tools,” or “weapons.”</span></a> in the building called the Forest of Lebanon were made from pure gold.

These were Hiram’s ships. Every three years the ships would come back with a new load of gold, silver, ivory, and apes and baboons. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>King Solomon became greater in riches and wisdom than any other king on earth.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>People everywhere wanted to see King Solomon and listen to the great wisdom that God had given him.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Every year people came to see the king and brought gifts made from gold and silver, clothes, weapons, spices, horses, and mules. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Solomon had a great number of chariots and horses. He had 1400 chariots and 12,000 horse soldiers. He built special cities for these chariots. So the chariots were kept in these cities. King Solomon also kept some of the chariots with him in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The king made Israel very rich. In the city of Jerusalem, silver was as common as rocks and cedar wood was as common as the many fig trees growing on the hills.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Solomon brought horses from Egypt and Kue. His traders bought them in Kue and brought them to Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>A chariot from Egypt cost about 15 pounds of silver, and a horse cost almost 4 pounds<a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> almost 4 pounds Literally, “150 shekels” (1.725 kg).</span></a> of silver.
