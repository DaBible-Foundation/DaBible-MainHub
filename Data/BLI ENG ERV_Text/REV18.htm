<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 18</div><div class='s'>Babylon Is Destroyed </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then I saw another angel coming down from heaven. This angel had great power. The angel’s glory made the earth bright.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The angel shouted with a powerful voice, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“She is destroyed! </div><div class='q2'>The great city of Babylon is destroyed! </div><div class='q'>She has become a home for demons. </div><div class='q2'>That city has become a place for every unclean spirit to live. </div><div class='q'>She is a city filled with all kinds of unclean birds. </div><div class='q2'>She is a place where every unclean and hated animal lives. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>All the peoples of the earth have drunk the wine </div><div class='q2'>of her sexual sin and of God’s anger. </div><div class='q'>The rulers of the earth sinned sexually with her, </div><div class='q2'>and the merchants of the world grew rich from the great wealth of her luxury.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then I heard another voice from heaven say, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“Come out of that city, my people, </div><div class='q2'>so that you will not share in her sins. </div><div class='q2'>Then you will not suffer any of the terrible punishment she will get. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>That city’s sins are piled up as high as heaven. </div><div class='q2'>God has not forgotten the wrongs she has done. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Give that city the same as she gave to others. </div><div class='q2'>Pay her back twice as much as she did. </div><div class='q'>Prepare wine for her that is twice as strong </div><div class='q2'>as the wine she prepared for others. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>She gave herself much glory and rich living. </div><div class='q2'>Give her that much suffering and sadness. </div><div class='q'>She says to herself, ‘I am a queen sitting on my throne. </div><div class='q2'>I am not a widow; </div><div class='q2'>I will never be sad.’ </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So in one day she will suffer </div><div class='q2'>great hunger, mourning, and death. </div><div class='q'>She will be destroyed by fire, </div><div class='q2'>because the Lord God who judges her is powerful. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“The rulers of the earth who sinned sexually with her and shared her wealth will see the smoke from her burning.

They will say, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>‘Terrible!

How terrible for the great city! </div><div class='q2'>She was dressed in fine linen; </div><div class='q2'>she wore purple and scarlet cloth. </div><div class='q2'>She was shining with gold, jewels, and pearls! </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>All these riches have been destroyed in one hour!’ </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'>“Every sea captain, all those who travel on ships, the sailors, and all those who earn money from the sea stood far away from Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They saw the smoke from her burning. They cried out, ‘There was never a city like this great city!’  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They threw dust on their heads and cried loudly to show the deep sorrow they felt. They said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>‘Terrible! How terrible for the great city! </div><div class='q2'>All those who had ships on the sea became rich because of her wealth! </div><div class='q2'>But she has been destroyed in one hour! </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Be happy because of this, O heaven! </div><div class='q2'>Be happy, God’s holy people and apostles and prophets! </div><div class='q'>God has punished her because of what she did to you.’ ” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then a powerful angel picked up a large rock. This rock was as big as a large millstone.
