They asked them this question: “For many years we have shown our sadness for the destruction of the Temple. In the fifth month of each year, we have had a special time of crying and fasting. Should we continue to do this?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I received this message from the LORD All-Powerful:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“Tell the priests and the other people in this country this: ‘For seventy years you fasted and showed your sadness in the fifth month and in the seventh month. But was that fasting really for me?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And when you ate and drank, was that for me? No, it was for your own good.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The LORD used the earlier prophets to say the same thing long ago.
