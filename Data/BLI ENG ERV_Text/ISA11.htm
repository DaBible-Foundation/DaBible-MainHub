He will not judge by listening to rumors.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4-5&#160;</span>He will judge the poor fairly and honestly. He will be fair when he decides what to do for the poor of the land. If he decides people should be beaten, he will give the command, and they will be beaten. If he decides people must die, he will give the command, and those evil people will be killed. Goodness and fairness will be like a belt he wears around his waist. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then wolves will live at peace with lambs, and leopards will lie down in peace with young goats.
