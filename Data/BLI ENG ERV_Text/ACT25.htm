<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 25</div><div class='s'>Paul Asks to See Caesar </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Festus became governor, and three days later he went from Caesarea to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The leading priests and the important Jewish leaders made charges against Paul before Festus.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>They asked Festus to do them a favor. They wanted him to send Paul back to Jerusalem because they had a plan to kill Paul on the way.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But Festus answered, “No, Paul will be kept in Caesarea. I will be going there soon myself,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>and your leaders can go with me. If this man has really done anything wrong, they can accuse him there.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Festus stayed in Jerusalem another eight or ten days and then went back to Caesarea. The next day Festus told the soldiers to bring Paul before him. Festus was seated on the judgment seat.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Paul came into the room, and the Jews who had come from Jerusalem stood around him. They made many serious charges against him, but they could not prove anything.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Paul defended himself, saying, “I have done nothing wrong against the Jewish law, against the Temple, or against Caesar.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But Festus wanted to please the Jews. So he asked Paul, “Do you want to go to Jerusalem for me to judge you there on these charges?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Paul said, “I am standing at Caesar’s judgment seat now. This is where I should be judged. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews, and you know it.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>If I have done something wrong and the law says I must die, then I agree that I should die. I don’t ask to be saved from death. But if these charges are not true, then no one can hand me over to these people. No, I want Caesar to hear my case!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Festus talked about this with his advisors. Then he said, “You have asked to see Caesar, so you will go to Caesar!” </div><div class='s'>Festus Asks King Agrippa About Paul </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>A few days later King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to visit Festus.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>They stayed there many days, and Festus told the king about Paul’s case. Festus said, “There is a man that Felix left in prison.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>When I went to Jerusalem, the leading priests and the older Jewish leaders there made charges against him. They wanted me to order his death.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But I told them, ‘When a man is accused of doing something wrong, Romans don’t hand him over for others to judge. First, he must face the people accusing him. And then he must be allowed to defend himself against their charges.’ </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>“So when these Jews came here for the trial, I did not waste time. The next day I sat on the judgment seat and ordered Paul to be brought in.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The Jews stood up and accused him. But they did not accuse him of the kind of crimes I thought they would.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Their charges were all about their own religion and about a man named Jesus. Jesus died, but Paul said that he is still alive.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>I did not have any idea about how to judge these matters. So I asked Paul, ‘Do you want to go to Jerusalem and be judged there?’  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But Paul asked to be kept in Caesarea. He wants a decision from the emperor. So I ordered that he be held until I could send him to Caesar in Rome.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Agrippa said to Festus, “I would like to hear this man too.” </div><div class='p'>Festus said, “Tomorrow you can hear him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The next day Agrippa and Bernice came to the meeting with great show, acting like very important people. They entered the room with military leaders and important men of the city. Festus ordered the soldiers to bring Paul in. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Festus said, “King Agrippa and all of you gathered here with us, you see this man. All the Jewish people, here and in Jerusalem, have complained to me about him. When they complain about him, they shout that he should be killed.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>When I judged him, I did not find him guilty of any crime worthy of death. But he asked to be judged by Caesar, so I decided to send him to Rome.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>However, I don’t really know what to tell Caesar that this man has done wrong. So I have brought him before all of you—especially you, King Agrippa. I hope that you can question him and give me something to write to Caesar.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>I think it is foolish to send a prisoner to Caesar without making some charges against him.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
