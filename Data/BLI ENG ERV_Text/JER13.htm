<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 13</div><div class='s'>The Sign of the Loincloth </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>This is what the LORD said to me: “Jeremiah, go and buy a linen loincloth.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> loincloth A common undergarment in ancient Judah. It was a short skirt that was wrapped around the hips. It reached about halfway down the thighs.</span></a> Then put it around your waist. Don’t let it get wet.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>So I bought a linen loincloth, just as the LORD told me to do, and I put it around my waist.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then the message from the LORD came to me a second time.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>This was the message: “Jeremiah, take the loincloth you bought and are wearing, and go to Perath.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Perath Probably a village near Jerusalem. This town is called Parah in the list of the cities of the land of Benjamin in Josh. 18:23. But this name also means the Euphrates River.</span></a> Hide the loincloth there in a crack in the rocks.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So I went to Perath and hid the loincloth there, just as the LORD told me to do.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Many days later the LORD said to me, “Now, Jeremiah, go to Perath. Get the loincloth that I told you to hide there.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So I went to Perath and dug the loincloth out of the crack in the rocks where I had hidden it. But now I could not wear the loincloth, because it was ruined. It was not good for anything. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then the message from the LORD came to me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>This is what the LORD said: “The loincloth is ruined and not good for anything. In the same way, I will ruin the proud people of Judah and Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I will ruin them because they refuse to listen to my messages. They are stubborn and do only what they want to do. They follow and worship other gods. They will be like this linen loincloth. They will be ruined and not good for anything.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>A loincloth is wrapped tightly around a man’s waist. In the same way, I wrapped the family of Israel and the family of Judah around me.” This message is from the LORD. “I did that so that they would be my people and bring me fame, praise, and honor. But my people did not listen to me.” </div><div class='s'>Warnings to Judah </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>“Jeremiah, say to the people of Judah: ‘This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Every wineskin should be filled with wine.’ They will laugh and say to you, ‘Of course, we know that every wineskin should be filled with wine.’  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then you will say to them, ‘This is what the LORD says: I will make everyone who lives in this land helpless, like a drunken man. I am talking about the kings who sit on David’s throne. I am also talking about the priests, the prophets, and all the people who live in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I will make them stumble and fall against each other, even the fathers and sons.’ This message is from the LORD. ‘I will not feel sorry or have pity for them. I will not allow compassion to stop me from destroying the people of Judah.’ ” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Listen and pay attention. </div><div class='q2'>The LORD has spoken to you. </div><div class='q2'>Do not be proud. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Honor the LORD your God. </div><div class='q2'>Praise him or he will bring darkness. </div><div class='q2'>Praise him before you fall on the dark hills. </div><div class='q'>You people of Judah are hoping for light, </div><div class='q2'>but the Lord will turn the light into thick darkness. </div><div class='q2'>He will change it into the deepest gloom. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If you people of Judah don’t listen to him, </div><div class='q2'>I will hide and cry. </div><div class='q'>Your pride will cause me to cry. </div><div class='q2'>I will cry very hard. </div><div class='q'>My eyes will overflow with tears, </div><div class='q2'>because the LORD’S flock<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> LORD’S flock This is a figurative name for the people of Judah.
