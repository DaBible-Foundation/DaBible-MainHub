<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 21</div><div class='s'>Finally, a Baby for Sarah </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The LORD came back to visit Sarah as he said he would, and he kept his promise to her.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>At exactly the time God said it would happen, Sarah became pregnant and gave birth to a son for Abraham in his old age.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Abraham named his son Isaac.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Isaac This name means “he laughs” or “he is happy.”</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Abraham did what God commanded and circumcised Isaac when he was eight days old. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Abraham was 100 years old when his son Isaac was born.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Sarah said, “God has made me happy, and everyone who hears about this will be happy with me.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>No one thought that I, Sarah, would be able to have Abraham’s child. But I have given Abraham a son, even though he is old.” </div><div class='s'>Trouble at Home </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Isaac continued to grow, and soon he was old enough to begin eating solid food. So Abraham gave a big party.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Sarah saw Hagar’s son playing. (Hagar was the Egyptian slave woman who gave birth to Abraham’s first son.)  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Sarah said to Abraham, “Get rid of that slave woman and her son. Send them away! When we die, our son Isaac will get everything we have. I don’t want that slave woman’s son sharing these things with my son Isaac!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>This upset Abraham very much. He was worried about his son Ishmael.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But God said to Abraham, “Don’t worry about the boy and the slave woman. Do what Sarah wants. Your descendants will be those who come through Isaac.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But I will also bless the son of your slave woman. He is your son, so I will make a great nation from his family also.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Early the next morning Abraham took some food and water and gave them to Hagar. She carried them and left with her boy. She left that place and wandered in the desert of Beersheba. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>After some time, when all their drinking water was gone, Hagar put her son under a bush.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then she walked a short distance away and sat down. She thought her son would die because there was no water. She did not want to watch him die. She sat there and began to cry. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>God heard the boy crying, and God’s angel called to Hagar from heaven. He said, “What is wrong, Hagar? Don’t be afraid! God has heard the boy crying there.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Go help the boy. Hold his hand and lead him. I will make him the father of many people.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then God allowed Hagar to see a well of water. So she went to the well and filled her bag with water. Then she gave water to the boy to drink. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>God continued to be with the boy while he grew up. Ishmael lived in the desert and became a hunter. He learned to shoot a bow very well.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>His mother found a wife for him in Egypt. They continued to live in the Paran desert. </div><div class='s'>Abraham’s Bargain With Abimelech </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then Abimelech and Phicol spoke with Abraham. Phicol was the commander of Abimelech’s army. They said to Abraham, “God is with you in everything you do.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So make a promise to me here before God. Promise that you will be fair with me and with my children. Promise that you will be kind to me and this country where you have lived. Promise that you will be as kind to me as I have been to you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Abraham said, “I promise to treat you the same way you have treated me.”  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then Abraham complained to Abimelech because Abimelech’s servants had captured a well of water. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But Abimelech said, “I don’t know who did this. You never told me about this before today!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>So Abraham and Abimelech made an agreement. Abraham gave Abimelech some sheep and cattle as proof of the agreement.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Abraham also put seven<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> seven The Hebrew word for “seven” is like the Hebrew word for “oath” or “promise,” and it is like the last part of the name Beersheba. The seven animals were proof of this promise.</span></a> female lambs in front of Abimelech. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Abimelech asked Abraham, “Why did you put these seven female lambs by themselves?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Abraham answered, “When you accept these lambs from me, it will be proof that I dug this well.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>So after that, the well was called Beersheba.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Beersheba This name means “well of the oath.”</span></a> Abraham gave the well this name because it was the place where they made a promise to each other. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>So Abraham and Abimelech made an agreement at Beersheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol, his military commander, went back to the country of the Philistines. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Abraham planted a special tree at Beersheba and prayed to the LORD, the God who lives forever.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Abraham lived as a stranger for a long time in the country of the Philistines. </div><ul class='tnav'>
