His followers were with him, and they were hungry. So they began to pick the grain and eat it.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The Pharisees saw this. They said to Jesus, “Look! Your followers are doing something that is against the law to do on the Sabbath day.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Jesus said to them, “You have read what David did when he and those with him were hungry.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>David went into God’s house. He and those with him ate the bread that was offered to God. It was against the law for David or those with him to eat that bread. Only the priests were allowed to eat it.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And you have read in the Law of Moses that on every Sabbath day the priests at the Temple break the law about the Sabbath day. But they are not wrong for doing that.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I tell you that there is something here that is greater than the Temple.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The Scriptures say, ‘I don’t want animal sacrifices; I want you to show kindness to people.’<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Hos. 6:6.</span></a> You don’t really know what that means. If you understood it, you would not judge those who have done nothing wrong. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“The Son of Man is Lord over the Sabbath day.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus Heals a Man on the Sabbath Day </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 3:1–6; Lk. 6:6–11) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Jesus went from there to their synagogue.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>In the synagogue there was a man with a crippled hand. Some Jews there were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus of doing wrong. So they asked him, “Is it right to heal on the Sabbath day?”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> “Is it right … day?” It was against Jewish law to work on the Sabbath day.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a ditch on the Sabbath day, you will take the sheep and help it out of the ditch.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Surely a man is more important than a sheep. So it is right to do good on the Sabbath day.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then Jesus said to the man with the crippled hand, “Hold out your hand.” The man held out his hand, and it became well again, the same as the other hand.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But the Pharisees left and made plans to kill Jesus. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Is God’s Chosen Servant </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Jesus knew what the Pharisees were planning. So he left that place, and many people followed him. He healed all who were sick,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>but he warned them not to tell others who he was.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>This was to give full meaning to what Isaiah the prophet said when he spoke for God: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>“Here is my servant, </div><div class='q2'>the one I have chosen. </div><div class='q'>He is the one I love, </div><div class='q2'>and I am very pleased with him. </div><div class='q'>I will fill him with my Spirit, </div><div class='q2'>and he will bring justice to the nations. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>He will not argue or shout; </div><div class='q2'>no one will hear his voice in the streets. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>He will not break off even a bent stem of grass.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> stem of grass Literally, “reed.”</span></a> </div><div class='q2'>He will not put out even the weakest flame. </div><div class='q'>He will not give up until he has made justice victorious. </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>All people will hope in him.” <span class='rq'>Isaiah 42:1-4</span> </div><div class='s'>Jesus’ Power Is From God </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 3:20–30; Lk. 11:14–23; 12:10) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then some people brought a man to Jesus. This man was blind and could not talk, because he had a demon inside him. Jesus healed the man, and he could talk and see.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>All the people were amazed at what Jesus did. They said, “Maybe he is the promised Son of David!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>When the Pharisees heard this, they said, “This man uses the power of Satan<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Satan Literally, “Beelzebul” (the devil). Also in verse 27.</span></a> to force demons out of people. Satan is the ruler of demons.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Jesus knew what the Pharisees were thinking. So he said to them, “Every kingdom that fights against itself will be destroyed. And every city or family that is divided against itself will not survive.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>So if Satan forces out his own demons,<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> if Satan … demons Literally, “if Satan forces out Satan.”</span></a> then he is fighting against himself, and his kingdom will not survive.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>You say that I use the power of Satan to force out demons. If that is true, then what power do your people use when they force out demons? So your own people will prove that you are wrong.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But I use the power of God’s Spirit to force out demons, and this shows that God’s kingdom has come to you.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Whoever wants to enter a strong man’s house and steal his things must first tie him up. Then they can steal the things from his house.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Whoever is not with me is against me. And anyone who does not work with me is working against me. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>“So I tell you, people can be forgiven for every sinful thing they do and for every bad thing they say against God. But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>You can even speak against the Son of Man and be forgiven. But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven—not now or in the future. </div><div class='s'>What You Do Shows What You Are </div><div class='r'>(Lk. 6:43–45) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>“If you want good fruit, you must make the tree good. If your tree is not good, it will have bad fruit. A tree is known by the kind of fruit it produces.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>You snakes! You are so evil. How can you say anything good? What people say with their mouths comes from what fills their hearts.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Those who are good have good things saved in their hearts. That’s why they say good things. But those who are evil have hearts full of evil, and that’s why they say things that are evil.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>I tell you that everyone will have to answer for all the careless things they have said. This will happen on the day of judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Your words will be used to judge you. What you have said will show whether you are right or whether you are guilty.” </div><div class='s'>Some People Doubt Jesus’ Authority </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 8:11–12; Lk. 11:29–32) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law answered Jesus. They said, “Teacher, we want to see you do a miracle as a sign from God.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “Evil and sinful people are the ones who want to see a miracle as a sign. But no miracle will be done to prove anything to them. The only sign will be the miracle that happened to the prophet Jonah.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Jonah The story of Jonah is found in the Old Testament book of Jonah.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Jonah was in the stomach of the big fish for three days and three nights. In the same way, the Son of Man will be in the grave three days and three nights.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>On the judgment day, you people who live now will be compared with the people from Nineveh,<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Nineveh City where Jonah preached. See Jonah 3.</span></a> and they will be witnesses who show how guilty you are. Why do I say this? Because when Jonah preached to those people, they changed their lives. And you are listening to someone greater than Jonah, but you refuse to change! </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>“On the judgment day, you people who live now will also be compared with the queen of the South,<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> queen of the South Or “queen of Sheba.” She traveled about 1000 miles (1600 km) to learn God’s wisdom from Solomon. See 1 Kings 10:1-13.</span></a> and she will be a witness who shows how guilty you are. I say this because she traveled from far, far away to listen to Solomon’s wise teaching. And I tell you that someone greater than Solomon is right here, but you won’t listen! </div><div class='s'>The Danger of Emptiness </div><div class='r'>(Lk. 11:24–26) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>“When an evil spirit comes out of a person, it travels through dry places looking for a place to rest, but it finds none.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>So it says, ‘I will go back to the home I left.’ When it comes back, it finds that home still empty. It is all neat and clean.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Then the evil spirit goes out and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself. They all go and live there, and that person has even more trouble than before. It is the same way with the evil people who live today.” </div><div class='s'>Jesus’ Followers Are His True Family </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 3:31–35; Lk. 8:19–21) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>While Jesus was talking to the people, his mother and brothers stood outside. They wanted to talk to him.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Someone told him, “Your mother and brothers are waiting for you outside. They want to talk to you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?”  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Then he pointed to his followers and said, “See! These people are my mother and my brothers.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Yes, anyone who does what my Father in heaven wants is my true brother and sister and mother.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
