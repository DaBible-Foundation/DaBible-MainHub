<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 16</div><div class='s'>Israel Complains, So God Sends Food </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then all the Israelites left Elim. They reached the western Sinai desert,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> western Sinai desert Literally, “desert of Sin.”</span></a> between Elim and Mount Sinai, on the 15th day of the second month<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> 15th day of the second month That is, the 15th of Iyyar. The Israelites had been traveling for a month.</span></a> after leaving Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then the whole community of Israelites began complaining again. They complained to Moses and Aaron in the desert.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>They said, “It would have been better if the LORD had just killed us in the land of Egypt. At least there we had plenty to eat. We had all the food we needed. But now you have brought us out here into this desert to make us all die from hunger.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then the LORD said to Moses, “I will cause food to fall from the sky. This food will be for you to eat. Every day the people should go out and gather the food they need that day. I will do this to see if they will do what I tell them.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Every day the people will gather only enough food for one day. But on Friday, when the people prepare their food, they will see that they have enough food for two days.”<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Friday, … two days This happened so that the people would not have to work on the Sabbath (Saturday), the day of rest.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So Moses and Aaron said to the Israelites, “Tonight you will see the power of the LORD. You will know that he is the one who brought you out of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>You have been complaining about the LORD, and he heard you. So tomorrow morning you will see the Glory of the LORD. You have been complaining and complaining about us. Maybe now we can have a little rest.”<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> You … rest Or “Who are we that you should be complaining about us?”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then Moses said, “In the evening the LORD will give you meat to eat, and in the morning you will have all the bread you want. The LORD will do this because he has heard your complaining, which was against him, not us. What can we do? We do only what he tells us to do, so your complaints are really against the LORD.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then Moses said to Aaron, “Tell the whole community of Israelites to come together before the LORD, because he has heard their complaints.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So Aaron spoke to all the Israelites. While he was talking, the people turned and looked into the desert. And they saw the Glory of the LORD appear in a cloud. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The LORD said to Moses,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>“I have heard the complaints of the Israelites. So tell them, ‘Tonight you will eat meat. And in the morning you will have all the bread you want. Then you will know you can trust the LORD, your God.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>That evening, flocks of quail came and filled the camp, and in the morning dew lay on the ground all around it.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>After the dew was gone, something like thin flakes of frost was on the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>When the Israelites saw it, they asked each other, “What is that?” because they did not know what it was. So Moses told them, “This is the food the LORD is giving you to eat.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The LORD says, ‘Each of you should gather what you need, a basket<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> basket Literally, “1 omer” (2.2 l). Also in verses 32, 33.</span></a> of manna for everyone in your family.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So that is what the Israelites did. Some people gathered a large amount, some people gathered a little.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But when they measured what they had gathered, there was no shortage and there was none left over. Everyone gathered just what they needed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Moses told them, “Don’t save that food to eat the next day.”  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But some of the people did not obey Moses. They saved their food for the next day. But worms got into the food and it began to stink. Moses was angry with the people who did this. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Every morning the people gathered as much food as they could eat, but by noon<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> noon Literally, “the heat of the day.”</span></a> the food melted and was gone. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>On Friday the people gathered twice as much food—two baskets<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> two baskets Literally, “2 omers” (4.4 l).</span></a> for every person. So all the leaders of the people came and told this to Moses. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Moses told them, “This is what the LORD said would happen. It happened because tomorrow is the Sabbath, the special day of rest to honor the LORD. You can cook all the food you need to cook for today, but save the rest of this food for tomorrow morning.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So the people saved the rest of the food for the next day, as Moses had commanded, and none of the food spoiled or had worms in it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>On Saturday, Moses told the people, “Today is the Sabbath, the special day of rest to honor the LORD. So none of you should be out in the fields. Eat the food you gathered yesterday.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>You should gather the food for six days. But the seventh day of the week is a day of rest—so there will not be any of the special food on the ground.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>On Saturday, some of the people went out to gather some of the food, but they could not find any.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then the LORD said to Moses, “How long will you people refuse to obey my commands and teachings?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Look, the LORD has made the Sabbath a day of rest for you. So on Friday he will give you enough food for two days. Then, on the Sabbath, each of you should sit down and relax. Stay where you are.”  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>So the people rested on the Sabbath. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The people called the special food “manna.<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> manna This name is like the Hebrew phrase in verse 15 meaning “What is that?”</span></a>” It was like small white coriander seeds and tasted like thin cakes made with honey.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Moses told the people what the LORD said: “Save a basket of this food for your descendants. Then they can see the food that I gave to you in the desert when I took you out of Egypt.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>So Moses told Aaron, “Take a jar and fill it with a full basket of manna. Save this manna to put before the LORD. Save it for our descendants.”  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>(Aaron did what the LORD had commanded Moses. Aaron put the jar of manna in front of the Box of the Agreement.)  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>The people ate the manna for 40 years, until they came to the land of rest, that is, until they came to the edge of the land of Canaan.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>(The measure they used for the manna was an omer. An omer was about 8 cups.<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> about 8 cups Literally, “1/10 of an ephah” (2.2 l).</span></a>) </div><ul class='tnav'>
