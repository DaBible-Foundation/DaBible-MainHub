<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 11</div><div class='s'>The Two Witnesses </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then I was given a measuring rod as long as a walking stick. I was told, “Go and measure the temple<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> temple God’s house—the place where God’s people worship and serve him. Here, John sees it pictured as the special building in Jerusalem for Jewish worship. Also in verse 19.</span></a> of God and the altar, and count the people worshiping there.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>But don’t measure the yard outside the temple. Leave it alone. It has been given to those who are not God’s people. They will show their power over the holy city for 42 months.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And I will give power to my two witnesses. And they will prophesy for 1260 days. They will be dressed in sackcloth.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>These two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>If anyone tries to hurt the witnesses, fire comes from the mouths of the witnesses and kills their enemies. Anyone who tries to hurt them will die like this.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>These witnesses have the power to stop the sky from raining during the time they are prophesying. These witnesses have power to make the water become blood. They have power to send every kind of plague to the earth. They can do this as many times as they want. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>When the two witnesses have finished telling their message, the beast will fight against them. This is the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit. It will defeat and kill them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The bodies of the two witnesses will lie in the street of the great city. This city is named Sodom and Egypt. These names for the city have a special meaning. This is the city where the Lord was killed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>People from every race of people, tribe, language, and nation will look at the bodies of the two witnesses for three and a half days. The people will refuse to bury them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Everyone on the earth will be happy because these two are dead. They will have parties and send each other gifts. They will do this because these two prophets brought much suffering to the people living on earth. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But after three and a half days, God let life enter the two witnesses again. They stood on their feet. All those who saw them were filled with fear.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then the two witnesses heard a loud voice from heaven say, “Come up here!” And both of them went up into heaven in a cloud. Their enemies watched them go. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>At that same time there was a great earthquake. A tenth of the city was destroyed. And 7000 people were killed in the earthquake. Those who did not die were very afraid. They gave glory to the God of heaven. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The second terror is now past. The third terror is coming soon. </div><div class='s'>The Seventh Trumpet Blast </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The seventh angel blew his trumpet. Then there were loud voices in heaven. The voices said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“The kingdom of the world has now become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah. </div><div class='q2'>And he will rule forever and ever.” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then the 24 elders bowed down on their faces and worshiped God. These are the elders who sit on their thrones before God.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The elders said, </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'>“We give thanks to you, Lord God All-Powerful. </div><div class='q2'>You are the one who is and who always was. </div><div class='q'>We thank you because you have used your great power </div><div class='q2'>and have begun to rule. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The people of the world were angry, </div><div class='q2'>but now is the time for your anger. </div><div class='q2'>Now is the time for the dead to be judged. </div><div class='q'>It is time to reward your servants, the prophets, </div><div class='q2'>and to reward your holy people, </div><div class='q2'>the people, great and small, who respect you. </div><div class='q'>It is time to destroy those people who destroy the earth!” </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then God’s temple in heaven was opened.
