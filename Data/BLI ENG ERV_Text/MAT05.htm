But when they do that, know that great blessings belong to you.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Be happy about it. Be very glad because you have a great reward waiting for you in heaven. People did these same bad things to the prophets who lived before you. </div><div class='s'>You Are Like Salt and Light </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 9:50; 4:21; Lk. 14:34–35; 8:16) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“You are the salt of the earth.

You are like a city built on a hill that cannot be hidden.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>People don’t hide a lamp under a bowl. They put it on a lampstand. Then the light shines for everyone in the house.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>In the same way, you should be a light for other people. Live so that they will see the good things you do and praise your Father in heaven. </div><div class='s'>Jesus and the Old Testament Writings </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>“Don’t think that I have come to destroy the Law of Moses or the teaching of the prophets. I have come not to destroy their teachings but to give full meaning to them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I assure you that nothing will disappear from the law until heaven and earth are gone. The law will not lose even the smallest letter or the smallest part of a letter until it has all been done. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>“A person should obey every command in the law, even one that does not seem important. Whoever refuses to obey any command and teaches others not to obey it will be the least important in God’s kingdom. But whoever obeys the law and teaches others to obey it will be great in God’s kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>I tell you that you must do better than the teachers of the law and the Pharisees. If you are not more pleasing to God than they are, you will never enter God’s kingdom. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Teaches About Anger </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>“You have heard that it was said to our people long ago, ‘You must not murder anyone.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Ex. 20:13; Deut. 5:17.</span></a> Any person who commits murder will be judged.’  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But I tell you, don’t be angry with anyone. If you are angry with others, you will be judged. And if you insult someone, you will be judged by the high court. And if you call someone a fool, you will be in danger of the fire of hell. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>“So, what if you are offering your gift at the altar and remember that someone has something against you?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Leave your gift there and go make peace with that person. Then come and offer your gift. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>“If anyone wants to take you to court, make friends with them quickly. Try to do that before you get to the court. If you don’t, they might hand you over to the judge. And the judge will hand you over to a guard, who will throw you into jail.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>I assure you that you will not leave there until you have paid everything you owe. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Teaches About Sexual Sin </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>“You have heard that it was said, ‘You must not commit adultery.’<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Ex. 20:14; Deut. 5:18.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But I tell you that if a man looks at a woman and wants to sin sexually with her, he has already committed that sin with her in his mind.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>If your right eye makes you sin, take it out and throw it away. It is better to lose one part of your body than to have your whole body thrown into hell.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>If your right hand makes you sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Teaches About Divorce </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 19:9; Mk. 10:11–12; Lk. 16:18) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>“It was also said, ‘Any man who divorces his wife must give her a written notice of divorce.’<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Deut. 24:1.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But I tell you that any man who divorces his wife, except for the problem of sexual sin, is causing his wife to be guilty of adultery. And whoever marries a divorced woman is guilty of adultery. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Teaches About Making Promises </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>“You have heard that it was said to our people long ago, ‘When you make a vow, you must not break your promise.

Don’t make a vow using the name of heaven, because heaven is God’s throne.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Don’t make a vow using the name of the earth, because the earth belongs to him.<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> the earth … him Literally, “it is the footstool of his feet.”</span></a> Don’t make a vow using the name of Jerusalem, because it also belongs to him, the great King.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And don’t even say that your own head is proof that you will keep your promise. You cannot make one hair on your head white or black.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Say only ‘yes’ if you mean ‘yes,’ and say only ‘no’ if you mean ‘no.’ If you say more than that, it is from the Evil One. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Teaches About Fighting Back </div><div class='r'>(Lk. 6:29–30) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Ex. 21:24; Lev. 24:20.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>But I tell you, don’t fight back against someone who wants to do harm to you.

Pray for those who treat you badly.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>If you do this, you will be children who are truly like your Father in heaven. He lets the sun rise for all people, whether they are good or bad. He sends rain to those who do right and to those who do wrong.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>If you love only those who love you, why should you get a reward for that? Even the tax collectors do that.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And if you are nice only to your friends, you are no better than anyone else. Even the people who don’t know God are nice to their friends.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>What I am saying is that you must be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect. </div><ul class='tnav'>
