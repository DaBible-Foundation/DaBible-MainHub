<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 15</div><div class='s'>Land for Judah </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The land that was given to Judah was divided among the families of that tribe. That land went to the border of Edom and south all the way to the desert of Zin at the edge of Teman.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The southern border of Judah’s land started at the south end of the Dead Sea.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The border went south to Scorpion Pass and continued on to Zin. Then the border continued south to Kadesh Barnea. It continued past Hezron to Addar. From Addar the border turned and continued to Karka.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The border continued to Azmon, the brook of Egypt, and then to the Mediterranean Sea. All that land was on their southern border. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Their eastern border was the shore of the Dead Sea to the area where the Jordan River flowed into the sea. </div><div class='p'>Their northern border started at the area where the Jordan River flowed into the Dead Sea.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then the northern border went to Beth Hoglah and continued north of Beth Arabah. The border continued to the stone of Bohan. (Bohan was the son of Reuben.)  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then the northern border went through the Valley of Achor to Debir. There the border turned to the north and went to Gilgal. Gilgal is across from the road that goes through the mountain of Adummim. It is on the south side of the brook. The border continued along the waters of En Shemesh. The border stopped at En Rogel.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then the border went through the Valley of Ben Hinnom beside the southern side of the Jebusite city (that is, Jerusalem). There the border went to the top of the hill on the west side of Hinnom Valley. This was at the northern end of Rephaim Valley.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>From there the border went to the spring of water of Nephtoah. Then the border went to the cities near Mount Ephron. There the border turned and went to Baalah. (Baalah is also called Kiriath Jearim.)  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>At Baalah the border turned west and went to the hill country of Seir. The border continued along the north side of Mount Jearim (Kesalon) and continued down to Beth Shemesh. From there the border went past Timnah.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then the border went to the hill north of Ekron. From there the border turned to Shikkeron and went past Mount Baalah. The border continued on to Jabneel and ended at the Mediterranean Sea.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The Mediterranean Sea was the western border. So the land of Judah was inside these four borders. The families of Judah lived in this area. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The LORD had commanded Joshua to give Caleb son of Jephunneh part of the land in Judah. So Joshua gave Caleb the land God had commanded. Joshua gave him the town of Kiriath Arba, that is, Hebron. (Arba was the father of Anak.)  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Caleb forced the three Anakite families living in Hebron to leave there. Those families were Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai. They were from the family of Anak.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then Caleb fought against the people living in Debir. (In the past, Debir was also called Kiriath Sepher.)  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Caleb said, “I will give my daughter in marriage to the man who attacks and conquers Kiriath Sepher.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Othniel was the son of Caleb’s brother Kenaz. Othniel defeated that city, so Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to Othniel to be his wife.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Acsah went to live with Othniel. Othniel told Acsah<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Othniel told Acsah Or “Acsah told Othniel.”</span></a> to ask her father Caleb for some more land. Acsah went to her father. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What do you want?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Acsah answered, “Give me a blessing.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Give me a blessing Or “Please welcome me” or “Give me a stream of water.”</span></a> You gave me dry desert land in the Negev. Please give me some land with water on it.” So Caleb gave her what she wanted. He gave her the upper and lower pools of water in that land. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The tribe of Judah got the land that God promised them. Each family group got part of the land. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The tribe of Judah got all the towns in the southern part of the Negev.
