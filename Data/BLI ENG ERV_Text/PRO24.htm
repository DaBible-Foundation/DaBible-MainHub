Have no desire to be around them.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>In their hearts they plan to do evil. All they talk about is making trouble. </div><div class='s'>— 20 — </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Good homes are built on wisdom and understanding.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Knowledge fills the rooms with rare and beautiful treasures. </div><div class='s'>— 21 — </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Wisdom makes a man more powerful. Knowledge gives a man strength.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Get good advice before you start a war. To win, you must have many good advisors. </div><div class='s'>— 22 — </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Fools cannot understand wisdom. They have nothing to say when people are discussing important things. </div><div class='s'>— 23 — </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>If you start planning ways to do wrong, people will learn that you are a troublemaker.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Such foolish plans are wrong, and people have no respect for someone who laughs at what is right. </div><div class='s'>— 24 — </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>If you are weak in times of trouble, that is real weakness. </div><div class='s'>— 25 — </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>If you see someone on their way to death or in danger of being killed, you must do something to save them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>You cannot say, “It’s none of my business.” The Lord knows everything, and he knows why you do things. He watches you, and he will pay you back for what you do. </div><div class='s'>— 26 — </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>My son, eat honey; it is good. Honey straight from the honeycomb is the sweetest.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>In the same way, know that wisdom is good for you. Wisdom will give you something to hope for that will not disappoint you. </div><div class='s'>— 27 — </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Don’t be like a criminal who makes plans to rob those who are good or take away their homes.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Good people might fall again and again, but they always get up. It is the wicked who are defeated by their troubles. </div><div class='s'>— 28 — </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Don’t be happy when your enemy has troubles. Don’t be glad when they fall.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The LORD will see this, and he might be upset with you and decide not to punish your enemy. </div><div class='s'>— 29 — </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Don’t let those who are evil upset you, and don’t be jealous of them.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>They have no hope. Their light will burn out. </div><div class='s'>— 30 — </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Son, respect the LORD and the king, and don’t join with those who are against them,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>because people like that can quickly be destroyed. You have no idea how much trouble God and the king can make for their enemies. </div><div class='s'>More Wise Sayings </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>These are also words from the wise: </div><div class='p'>A judge must be fair. He must not support some people simply because he knows them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The people will turn against a judge who lets the guilty go free. Even the people of other nations will curse him.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But if a judge punishes the guilty, then people will be happy with him, and he will be a blessing to them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>An honest answer is as pleasing as a kiss on the lips. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>First get your fields ready, next plant your crops, and then build your house. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Don’t speak against someone without a good reason, or you will appear foolish. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Don’t say, “You hurt me, so I will do the same to you. I will punish you for what you did to me.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>I walked past a field that belonged to a lazy man. It was a vineyard that belonged to someone who understood nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Weeds were growing everywhere! Wild vines covered the ground, and the wall around the vineyard was broken and falling down.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>I looked at this and thought about it. This is what I learned:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>a little sleep, a little rest, folding your arms, and taking a nap—  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>these things will make you poor very quickly. Soon you will have nothing, as if a thief broke in and took everything away. </div><ul class='tnav'>
