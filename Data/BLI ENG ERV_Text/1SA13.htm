They felt trapped. They ran away to hide in caves and cracks in the rock. They hid among the rocks, in wells, and in other holes in the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Some Hebrews even went across the Jordan River to the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul was still at Gilgal. All the men in his army were shaking with fear. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Samuel said he would meet Saul at Gilgal. Saul waited there seven days. But Samuel had not yet come to Gilgal, and the soldiers began to leave Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So Saul said, “Bring me the burnt offerings and the fellowship offerings.” Then Saul offered the burnt offering.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>As soon as Saul finished offering that sacrifice, Samuel arrived. Saul went out to meet him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Samuel asked, “What have you done?” </div><div class='p'>Saul answered, “I saw the soldiers leaving me.

You did not obey the LORD your God. If you had done what he commanded, the LORD would have let your family rule Israel forever.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But now your kingdom won’t continue.

Saul counted the men who were still with him. There were about 600.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Saul, his son Jonathan, and the soldiers went to Geba in Benjamin. </div><div class='p'>The Philistines were camped at Micmash.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So their best soldiers began the attack. The Philistine army split into three groups. One group went north on the road to Ophrah, near Shual.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The second group went southeast on the road to Beth Horon, and the third group went east on the road to the border. That road looks over the Valley of Zeboim toward the desert. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>There were no blacksmiths in Israel. The Philistines would not allow them because they were afraid the Israelites would make iron swords and spears.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Only the Philistines could sharpen iron tools. So if the Israelites needed to sharpen their plows, hoes, axes, or sickles, they had to go to the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The Philistine blacksmiths charged 1/3 ounce<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> 1/3 ounce Literally, “1 <span class='tl'>pim</span>” (7.8 g).</span></a> of silver for sharpening plows and hoes and 1/6 ounce<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> 1/6 ounce Literally, “1/3 shekel” (3.8 g).</span></a> of silver for sharpening picks, axes, and the iron tip on ox goads.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So on the day of battle, none of the Israelite soldiers with Saul had iron swords or spears.
