They came to the towns of Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives. There Jesus sent two of his followers to do something.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He said to them, “Go to the town you can see there. When you enter it, you will find a young donkey that no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here to me.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>If anyone asks you why you are taking the donkey, tell them, ‘The Master needs it. He will send it back soon.’ ” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The followers went into the town. They found a young donkey tied in the street near the door of a house, and they untied it.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Some people were standing there and saw this. They asked, “What are you doing? Why are you untying that donkey?”  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The followers answered the way Jesus told them, and the people let them take the donkey. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The followers brought the donkey to Jesus. They put their coats on it, and Jesus sat on it.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Many people spread their coats on the road for Jesus. Others cut branches in the fields and spread the branches on the road.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Some of them were walking ahead of Jesus. Others were walking behind him.

He looked at everything in the Temple area, but it was already late. So he went to Bethany with the twelve apostles. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Says a Fig Tree Will Die </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 21:18–19) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The next day, Jesus was leaving Bethany. He was hungry.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He saw a fig tree with leaves. So he went to the tree to see if it had any figs growing on it. But he found no figs on the tree. There were only leaves, because it was not the right time for figs to grow.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So Jesus said to the tree, “People will never eat fruit from you again.” His followers heard him say this. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Goes to the Temple </div><div class='r'>(Mt. 21:12–17; Lk. 19:45–48; Jn. 2:13–22) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>When Jesus and his followers came to Jerusalem, they entered the Temple area. Jesus began driving out the people who were buying and selling things there. He turned over the tables that belonged to those who were exchanging different kinds of money. And he turned over the benches of those who were selling doves.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He refused to allow anyone to carry things through the Temple area.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then Jesus began teaching the people and said, “It is written in the Scriptures, ‘My Temple will be called a house of prayer for all nations.’<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Isa. 56:7.</span></a> But you have changed it into a ‘hiding place for thieves.’<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Jer. 7:11.</span></a>” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>When the leading priests and the teachers of the law heard what Jesus said, they began trying to find a way to kill him.

They saw the fig tree that he spoke to the day before. The tree was dry and dead, even the roots.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Peter remembered the tree and said to Jesus, “Teacher, look! Yesterday, you told that fig tree to die. Now it is dry and dead!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Jesus answered, “Have faith in God.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The truth is, you can say to this mountain, ‘Go, mountain, fall into the sea.’ And if you have no doubts in your mind and believe that what you say will happen, then God will do it for you.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So I tell you to ask for what you want in prayer. And if you believe that you have received those things, then they will be yours.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>When you are praying and you remember that you are angry with another person about something, forgive that person.
