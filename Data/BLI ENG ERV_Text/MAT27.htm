He was the one who had handed him over. When he saw what happened, he was very sorry for what he had done. So he took the 30 silver coins back to the leading priests and the older leaders.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Judas said, “I sinned. I handed over to you an innocent man to be killed.” </div><div class='p'>The Jewish leaders answered, “We don’t care! That’s a problem for you, not us.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So Judas threw the money into the Temple. Then he went out from there and hanged himself. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The leading priests picked up the silver coins in the Temple. They said, “Our law does not allow us to keep this money with the Temple money, because this money has paid for a man’s death.”  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So they decided to use the money to buy a field called Potter’s Field. This field would be a place to bury people who died while visiting in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>That is why that field is still called the Field of Blood.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>This showed the full meaning of what Jeremiah the prophet said: </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='mi'>“They took 30 silver coins. That was how much the people of Israel decided to pay for his life.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They used those 30 silver coins to buy the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> “They took … me” See Zech. 11:12-13; Jer. 32:6-9.</span></a> </div><div class='s'>Governor Pilate Questions Jesus </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 15:2–5; Lk. 23:3–5; Jn. 18:33–38) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Jesus stood before Pilate, the governor, who asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” </div><div class='p'>Jesus answered, “Yes, that’s right.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then, when the leading priests and the older Jewish leaders made their accusations against Jesus, he said nothing. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear all these charges they are making against you? Why don’t you answer?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But Jesus did not say anything, and this really surprised the governor. </div><div class='s'>Pilate Tries but Fails to Free Jesus </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 15:6–15; Lk. 23:13–25; Jn. 18:39–19:16) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Every year at Passover time the governor would free one prisoner—whichever one the people wanted him to free.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>At that time there was a man in prison who was known to be very bad. His name was Barabbas.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Barabbas In some Greek copies the name is Jesus Barabbas.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>When a crowd gathered, Pilate said to them, “I will free one man for you. Which one do you want me to free: Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Messiah?”  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Pilate knew that they had handed Jesus over to him because they were jealous of him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>While Pilate was sitting there in the place for judging, his wife sent a message to him. It said, “Don’t do anything with that man. He is not guilty. Last night I had a dream about him, and it troubled me very much.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But the leading priests and older Jewish leaders told the people to ask for Barabbas to be set free and for Jesus to be killed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Pilate said, “I have Barabbas and Jesus. Which one do you want me to set free for you?” </div><div class='p'>The people answered, “Barabbas!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Pilate asked, “So what should I do with Jesus, the one called the Messiah?” </div><div class='p'>All the people said, “Kill him on a cross!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Pilate asked, “Why do you want me to kill him? What wrong has he done?” </div><div class='p'>But they shouted louder, “Kill him on a cross!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Pilate saw that there was nothing he could do to make the people change. In fact, it looked as if there would be a riot. So he took some water and washed his hands<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> washed his hands Pilate did this as a sign to show that he wanted no part in what the people did.</span></a> in front of them all. He said, “I am not guilty of this man’s death. You are the ones who are doing it!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The people answered, “We will take full responsibility for his death. You can blame us and even our children!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then Pilate set Barabbas free. And he told some soldiers to beat Jesus with whips. Then he handed him over to the soldiers to be killed on a cross. </div><div class='s'>Pilate’s Soldiers Make Fun of Jesus </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 15:16–20; Jn. 19:2–3) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then Pilate’s soldiers took Jesus into the governor’s palace. All the soldiers gathered around him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>They took off Jesus’ clothes and put a red robe on him.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then they made a crown from thorny branches and put it on his head, and they put a stick in his right hand. Then they bowed before him, making fun of him. They said, “We salute you, king of the Jews!”  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>They spit on him. Then they took his stick and kept hitting him on the head with it.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>After they finished making fun of him, the soldiers took off the robe and put his own clothes on him again. Then they led him away to be killed on a cross. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Is Nailed to a Cross </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 15:21–32; Lk. 23:26–39; Jn. 19:17–19) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The soldiers were going out of the city with Jesus. They saw a man from Cyrene named Simon, and they forced him to carry Jesus’ cross.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>They came to the place called Golgotha. (Golgotha means “The Place of the Skull.”)  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>There the soldiers gave Jesus some wine mixed with gall.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> gall Probably used as a drug to relieve pain.</span></a> But when he tasted it, he refused to drink it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>The soldiers nailed Jesus to a cross. Then they threw dice to divide his clothes between them.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>The soldiers stayed there to guard him.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>They put a sign above his head with the charge against him written on it: “<span class='sc'>this is jesus, the king of the jews</span>.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Two criminals were nailed to crosses beside Jesus—one on the right and the other on the left.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>People walked by and shouted insults at Jesus. They shook their heads  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>and said, “You said you could destroy the Temple and build it again in three days. So save yourself! Come down from that cross if you really are the Son of God!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>The leading priests, the teachers of the law, and the older Jewish leaders were also there. They made fun of Jesus the same as the other people did.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>They said, “He saved others, but he can’t save himself! People say he is the king of Israel. If he is the king, he should come down now from the cross. Then we will believe in him.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>He trusted God. So let God save him now, if God really wants him. He himself said, ‘I am the Son of God.’ ”  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And in the same way, the criminals on the crosses beside Jesus also insulted him. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Dies </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 15:33–41; Lk. 23:44–49; Jn. 19:28–30) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>At noon the whole country became dark. The darkness continued for three hours.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>About three o’clock Jesus cried out loudly, <span class='tl'>“Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?”</span> This means “My God, my God, why have you left me alone?”<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Quote from Ps. 22:1.</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Some of the people standing there heard this.

He filled the sponge with sour wine and tied the sponge to a stick. Then he used the stick to give the sponge to Jesus to get a drink from it.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>But the others said, “Don’t bother him. We want to see if Elijah will come to save him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Again Jesus cried out loudly and then died.<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> died Literally, “let his spirit leave.”</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>When Jesus died, the curtain in the Temple was torn into two pieces. The tear started at the top and tore all the way to the bottom. Also, the earth shook and rocks were broken.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>The graves opened, and many of God’s people who had died were raised from death.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>They came out of the graves. And after Jesus was raised from death, they went into the holy city, and many people saw them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>The army officer and the soldiers guarding Jesus saw this earthquake and everything that happened. They were very afraid and said, “He really was the Son of God!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>Many women were standing away from the cross, watching. These were the women who had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for him.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of James and John<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> James and John Literally, “the sons of Zebedee.”</span></a> were there. </div><div class='s'>Jesus Is Buried </div><div class='r'>(Mk. 15:42–47; Lk. 23:50–56; Jn. 19:38–42) </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>That evening a rich man named Joseph came to Jerusalem. He was a follower of Jesus from the town of Arimathea.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>He went to Pilate and asked to have Jesus’ body. Pilate gave orders for the soldiers to give Jesus’ body to him.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>Then Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a new linen cloth.  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>He put Jesus’ body in a new tomb that he had dug in a wall of rock. Then he closed the tomb by rolling a very large stone to cover the entrance. After he did this, he went away.  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>Mary Magdalene and the other woman named Mary were sitting near the tomb. </div><div class='s'>The Tomb of Jesus Is Guarded </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>That day was the day called Preparation day. The next day, the leading priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>They said, “Sir, we remember that while that liar was still alive he said, ‘I will rise from death in three days.’  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>So give the order for the tomb to be guarded well for three days. His followers might come and try to steal the body. Then they could tell everyone that he has risen from death. That lie will be even worse than what they said about him before.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>Pilate said, “Take some soldiers and go guard the tomb the best way you know.”  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>So they all went to the tomb and made it safe from thieves. They did this by sealing the stone in the entrance and putting soldiers there to guard it. </div><ul class='tnav'>
