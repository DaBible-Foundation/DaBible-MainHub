Do this for the Lord. Obey the king, the highest authority.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And obey the leaders who are sent by the king. They are sent to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do good.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>When you do good, you stop ignorant people from saying foolish things about you. This is what God wants.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Live like free people, but don’t use your freedom as an excuse to do evil.

But if you suffer for doing good and you are patient, this pleases God.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>This is what you were chosen to do. Christ gave you an example to follow.

He did this so that we would stop living for sin and live for what is right. By his wounds you were healed.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>You were like sheep that went the wrong way.
