Welcome to DaBible Foundation's MainHub. Here, DaBible team members work together. Project managers, developers, designers, analysts, writers, and volunteers, come together here to coordinate, track, and update our work in one place, so projects stay transparent and on schedule.

We run an open-source organization which means, everyone can contribute! Yes, you read it right, *YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE!*. Check our handbook for details.

We currently have two mobile apps, Yoruba Audio Bible, and Pidgin Audio Bible,  which are available on both Apple Store and Google Play. Currently, we have finished the recording of our Hausa Audio Bible, which will be released in 2021. We are also looking forward to volunteers and sponsors, who will love to work with us on the Igbo Audio Bible and other Nigerian languages.
